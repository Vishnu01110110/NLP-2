                                about citywide services and resources and function as a one-stop shop for resident needs. This is the first of several 
                                guides we hope to publish on the website, each curated for a different community in Pittsburgh and translated into 
                                different languages. To ensure accuracy, relevance, and cultural appropriateness the team sought input from a diverse 
                                group of stakeholders.  It is our hope that you will find the content of the guide useful. You can browse the categories in the menu to the right. The city launched a new website in the fall of 2017. Part of the goals of the new site was to provide the opportunity for 
                                Resident Guides to be created. After consulting various groups, it was decided that the first guide should be targeted 
                                toward the Hispanic/Latinx communities. We collected feedback from service providers, community members and local leaders 
                                in the Hispanic/Latinx community about what resources and topics are most important to individuals who are new to 
                                Pittsburgh. After collecting all of the information, we created an English guide that was then translated into Spanish by 
                                Nereida Daza of the Latino Community Center. As information changes, it is our goal to update the guide every three months.  If you see information that is incorrect,

To support the city’s rapidly growing event & film industry, the Office of Film & Event Management has streamlined the permitting process for event organizers and film producers via efficient digital permitting. In addition to streamlining the permitting process for events & film projects in the City of Pittsburgh, the Office of Film & Event Management will also be responsible for the following: OFEM is tasked with receiving and vetting applications for small and large-scale events and film productions within the City of Pittsburgh as well as consulting with both film and event permit applicants to ensure that industry standards, safety regulations, and city policies are followed and met. Via the Special Events Committee, OFEM also works with all City departments to ensure proper planning, coordination, and execution of all events and film projects. Additionally, it will ensure that events and film productions do not negatively impact the City’s operations and remain positive assets to the City and its residents. New Permit Management System Launch!  Beginning in the spring of 2024, the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) will be launching a new permit management system, Eproval! With the launch of this new system comes a new two-phase application approach to special event permitting. The new process will allow event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event. Previously, applicants would need to wait until many details of their event were in place before they could apply. Now, applicants can secure their venue and dates, then move forward with hiring all of their vendors and performers with the comfort of knowing they have a secure venue and dates. Please see the release below for more information on EProval, and please visit the Special Event & Block Party Permitting page for information on the new application process. Please check out the “Getting Started: Event Permits” for information on the entire permitting process! New Features with Eproval! In addition to being able to secure their event venue prior to completing all event-specific details, Eproval provides several new exciting features that will make the event permitting process more streamlined for applicants. Among them: For general information and guidance, please reach out to the Office of Film & Event Management at the contact info below. Hours: 8:00am - 4:45pm EST Monday- Friday

CAREERS CONTACT US FOLLOW US GUÍA DE RESIDENTES DEPARTMENT MENU Pittsburgh About Pittsburgh History   


Pittsburgh was founded on November 27, 1758. The city was named by General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, the 1st Earl of Chatham. Early on, Pittsburgh played an important role in our country’s history. In the early 1800s, the city became known as the “Gateway to the West.” This nickname referenced the huge advantage Pittsburgh had by having the intersection of three major waterways. The Allegheny River and Monongahela River join together at what is known as the “point” to form the Ohio River. This intersection opened the gates for Pittsburgh to lead the way in the trade industry for products such as coal, timber, glass, natural gas, iron and limestone. By 1911, Pittsburgh manufactured half of the nation’s steel. Due to the amount of pollution given off by the steel factories the city had a new nickname - “The Smoky City."
Throughout the years, Pittsburgh has made multiple changes and overcome many obstacles. The city has moved from the steel industry to become a leader in healthcare, education, technology, and financial services. What were once heavily polluted streets and riverfronts, have been transformed to create the modern vibrant Pittsburgh one sees today.




Population Statistics   


The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the sixth largest populated state in the United States. Pittsburgh is the second largest city in Pennsylvania and has an estimated of 310,000 people. The population consists of 51.9% females and 48.9% males, with the average age being 33. Pittsburgh, serves as the County Seat of Allegheny County which has an estimated population of 1.2 million. Pittsburgh serves as the principal city of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area, or Greater Pittsburgh. This 8 county area has an estimated population of 2.6 million.




Community   


The City of Pittsburgh offers everything a person might be looking for in a home, with its wonderful shopping areas, great restaurants, and beautiful views. Pittsburgh is known for having more named neighborhoods than any American city. Ninety distinct communities collectively create the culture of Pittsburgh. The Strip District is a wonderful market spot known for its variety of food and an excellent shopping with unique stores. The neighborhoods known as Shadyside, Beechview, or the West End are other fantastic region of Pittsburgh to find trendy shops and restaurants. If you’re looking for authentic homemade Italian food, Bloomfield or “Pittsburgh’s Little Italy” is the place for you. If you’re looking for more of a creative and artistic side of Pittsburgh, pass through the neighborhood of Lawrenceville.
East Liberty is known as for business and industries. Looking for a fun night out on the town? South Side has a fun and exciting nightlife full of clubs, sports bars, and laid-back pubs. Wanting to catch a game or spend some quality time with your loved ones? The North Shore or North Side is the place to be. Mount Washington is the high point of Pittsburgh; it gives the residents of Pittsburgh and tourists a beautiful view of this magnificent city. Finally, Downtown, like most downtown districts, has great food, dining, parks, plazas, and art museums.

The Mayor’s Office is leading implementation of the plan through cross-sectoral partnerships. Welcoming Pittsburgh is rooted in a commitment to ensure a more livable city for all residents. Welcoming Pittsburgh is an initiative meant to live within the community. Since its launch, Welcoming Pittsburgh has transformed into a platform to highlight the hard work that Pittsburgh leaders do to show our newcomers welcome. Instead of directing the conversation, the city aims to support the dialogue that is already happening in order to successfully address the needs of the community. Through support of immigrant centered events, projects, and initiatives, the City of Pittsburgh is committed to engaging as much of our immigrant, refugee, and asylee communities as possible.

The Roadmap outlines 37 community-led recommendations grouped into 3 categories Welcome Neighbor, Bridge to the City, and Prospering Together all to advance welcoming efforts in the City. The work of Welcoming Pittsburgh includes the 37 recommendations, as well as emerging priorities of the community that goes beyond the original roadmap. To better fulfill the recommendations and to align our efforts with a broader county outlook, we have grouped the recommendations(both in the roadmap and beyond) into 6 categories: Civic & Community Engagement, Education, Language Access, Economic Development, Sustaining the Plan, and Beyond the Roadmap.

Engage Pittsburgh Search this site... Snow Angels You are here: Update March 2024 To all of our volunteers, thank you for a great 2023-2024 season! We're not collecting volunteers or recipient information at this time. Follow this page, or leave your contact information in the form below to be notified when this program re-opens for the 2024-2025 season. What is the Snow Angels Program?  Helping your neighbors is SNOW much fun! Snow-covered sidewalks can be hazardous for everyone. The City of Pittsburgh’s Snow Angels Program pairs older residents and residents with disabilities with nearby neighbors who volunteer to assist them with snow removal on their sidewalks and walkways. Along with fostering stronger community relationships and relieving some of the stress that comes from a snowfall or freeze, Snow Angels make our sidewalks safer for those who are outside during the winter weather, like postal carriers, firefighters, police officers, and other neighbors. In 2023, we encouraged couches, faith-based and community leaders to sign up their groups as Snow Angels to support their neighbors in need. Requirements for Snow Angel Recipients We are not accepting applications for Snow Angel service at this time. Follow this page, or leave your contact information in the form above to be notified when the program reopens for the 2024-2025 season.  If you’d like a neighbor to come help break the ice! Here are the requirements neighbors must meet to request a Snow Angel: Be at least 62 years old, or have a physical disability. Live within the City of Pittsburgh. Click here to find out if you live within city limits. Do not have resources (financial or family and friends nearby) to assist with snow removal. Things to know before signing up: Volunteer FAQ How will I know if I've been selected as a Snow Angel Volunteer? Is there a deadline to sign up? I signed up, but haven't been assigned a neighbor in need. Now what? How soon do I have to shovel for my neighbor? Can I help more people? Recipient FAQ How will I know if I have a Snow Angel? How soon will my sidewalk be shoveled? Questions?

CAREERS CONTACT US FOLLOW US GUÍA DE RESIDENTES DEPARTMENT MENU Weather Resource Center Snow Plow Tracker App v.2.0 What does the Plow Tracker 2.0 show me? The Plow Tracker v 2.0 displays the history trail of Public Works vehicles conducting deicing and/or anti-icing and plowing operations. Vehicle travel on City streets is displayed with a pink history trail. Street treatment efforts can be tracked within the last 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours by selecting the desired interval below the map. Roads are color-coded to show the City’s treatment responsibilities. Where are the trucks treating the city’s streets? Current vehicle location is displayed with a vehicle icon on the screen on the “Now” and 2, 4, 12, and 24 interval time displays. The Plow Tracker v 2.0 does not display the current location of vehicles traveling slower than 2.5 m.p.h., or if the ignition is off. To ensure drivers are able to treat the roads without interruption, vehicle icons are presented with a time delay. How can I navigate to my street? Users of the Plow Tracker 2.0 can zoom in on the map to view their street or select their street from the drop-down menu located below the history display buttons. What does treatment mean? Treatment is the application of anti-icing (before snow and ice arrive) and / or deicing (after snow / ice have fallen) materials. While their application indicates that the street has been treated it does not indicate that a street will be clear of any snow/ ice – that will happen when the temperatures are favorable (rising, not falling), the sun is prevalent and pedestrians and vehicles work the deicing and/or anti-icing material. Primary and secondary streets are treated simultaneously but during heavy snow or changing weather conditions Public Works vehicles may return to treating only primaries prior to returning to secondary and tertiary routes. The streets are categorized based on traffic volume. Who owns/maintains the street? In addition to City streets, Public Works conducts deicing and/or anti-icing operations on certain Allegheny County, and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania roads. Later this winter weather season we will update the Plow Tracker map to display city snow and ice treatment responsibility. Why do trucks go on streets that the city does not own or maintain? There are times that Public Works vehicles travel on streets they do not own or maintain: Why did the truck go halfway up the street and turn around? To apply deicing and/or anti-icing materials to streets during a winter weather event Public Works drivers may turn their vehicle around and back up steep hills because this is the most efficient and safest manner to treat the street. In other instances, drivers may encounter difficulty accessing narrow streets when cars are parked too far into the roadway. In such cases, the driver has to return in the hope the vehicle has moved or return with a smaller piece of equipment. Why is my de-icing material blue? For the 2018-19 winter weather season, Public Works is treating roads with a new rock salt made of Magnesium Chloride instead of Sodium Chloride treated with liquid Calcium Chloride. Magnesium Chloride is expected to have a lower melting point and better deicing capabilities, particularly at lower temperatures. Our new deicing material is treated with a blue pigment that enables residents and drivers to be better able to determine if the street has recently been treated. How can I help Public Works treat my street? When driving: When parking: When shoveling: Please be patient and give our crews the time needed to treat over 1,200 miles of streets. What are the snow levels and what do they mean? Public Works classifies storm conditions into Levels, which determine the required response for a given winter weather event. Based on the Levels, residents and drivers can expect that all streets will be treated in the following manner. Know that while there are periods when it is not snowing, that does not mean the weather event has ended. Level 0: No service response required.

CAREERS CONTACT US FOLLOW US GUÍA DE RESIDENTES DEPARTMENT MENU City Information Center Policies Right to Know Policy On January 1, 2009, a new Right to Know Law (the "RTKL") took effect in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Under this statute, public records of the City of Pittsburgh are generally available to citizens who request them. The following outlines the basic provisions of the RTKL and the procedures for making a request for records: I. PUBLIC RECORDS The Right to Know Law defines a public record as information, regardless of physical form, which documents a transaction or activity of the City, and that is created, received or retained pursuant to law or in connection with a transaction, business or activity of the City. A record is NOT a public record if: Generally, public records are to be open for inspection or duplication in accordance with the RTKL. Records are to be provided in the medium requested if they exist in that medium. Otherwise, they are to be provided in the medium in which they exist. The RTKL does not require the City to give computer access to any requester. When responding to a request, the City is not required to create a record that does not presently exist. Nor is the City required to compile, maintain, format, or organize a record in a manner in which the City does not currently maintain, format, or organize the record. II. MAKING A REQUEST All Right to Know requests for information ("requests") must be submitted to the Open Records Officer ("ORO") of the City of Pittsburgh: There are four ways to request a public record from the City: 1) In person; 2) By mail; 3) By e-mail; and 4) By fax. Requests may be verbal or written. However, if a verbal request is denied by the City, there is no right of appeal. The Right to Know Law does not require the City to accept requests made by telephone, and the City will refuse to accept requests made by telephone. The Right to Know Law also does not require the City to accept anonymous requests, and the City will refuse to accept anonymous requests. For the purpose of this section, an e-mail request which does not contain a proper name or street address will be treated as an anonymous request. In order to meet the requirements of the Right to Know Law, the request must: The request need not state the reason that the records are being requested. The City has chosen to use the Standard Request Form promulgated by the Pennsylvania Open Records Office. This form may be downloaded from the website of the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records. A hard-copy form may also be obtained from the City's ORO at the address above. The City may deny "disruptive requests," which occur when a requester repeatedly requests the same record. However, the requester is not precluded from requesting a different record. III. THE CITY'S RESPONSE TO A RIGHT TO KNOW REQUEST Although individual City departments shall be required to expeditiously forward requests inadvertently sent to them instead of directly to the ORO, the time period for the City's response will begin to run as of the documented receipt of the request by the ORO. Requests received after 4:30 p.m. shall be deemed to be received on the next business day. Upon receipt of a request by the Open Records Officer, the City will make a good faith effort to determine whether the record requested is a public record, and whether the City has custody of the record. The City will respond as rapidly as possible under the circumstances existing at the time of the request. However, the City will respond within five business days of the initial request. A "business day" shall be any weekday (Monday through Friday) except for official holiday closings or closings due to weather or natural disasters or due to the request of authorized public safety officials. Failure to respond within five business days will constitute a deemed denial of the request. The RTKL does not require that the requester receive the City's response on the fifth business day. The City meets is obligations by mailing the response on the fifth business day. The City will respond to each request in one of three ways: There are circumstances set forth in the RTLK under which the City can take additional time to process a right to know request. The City is required to notify the requester in the "five day" letter which of these circumstances apply: If the City requires additional time to process a right to know request, it must nevertheless make its initial response within the five business day period. The letter will indicate which of the reasons justify the additional time, and will project a target date by which the records will be made available. The City cannot take more than thirty additional days without the written consent of the Requester. If such permission is not granted and the City takes more than thirty days from the expiration of the five business day period, the request will be deemed denied on the thirty-first day. If the City denies a request for information (in whole or in part), it will issue a denial letter which will include: IV. FEES The City may charge reasonable fees for copying as well as its actual costs for postage in fulfilling a Right to Know request.  These fees are posted on the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records website. If copying fees do not exceed five dollars, the copies and postage will be provided free of charge as a courtesy of the City of Pittsburgh. If copying fees exceed five dollars, the fees and postage must be pre-paid before the records will be provided. The fee can be paid by check or money order payable to: If the fees associated with a right to know request are anticipated to be greater than $100.00, the fees must be paid in advance before the City is obligated to compile the records. V. APPEALS The appeal must be made within fifteen business days of the City's denial or deemed denial, and must set forth the grounds on which the requester believes that the record is a public record, and the grounds for the denial by the City. The Pennsylvania Office of Open Records will assign an appeals officer to the case, and the appeals officer will issue a decision within thirty days of the receipt of the appeal. The decision of the appeals officer may be appealed to the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. VI. POLICIES The City of Pittsburgh retains the discretion and authority to adopt any other written policies that are consistent with the Right to Know Law. Amendments to this policy will take effect upon publication on the City's website.

A century ago women in this nation won their decades long fight for suffrage. Rarely acknowledged for their integral part in the struggle for the vote, a feisty contingent of Pittsburgh women used their intelligence, wits and endurance to mount a fierce campaign against 
                                forces that employed all their might to deny them the vote. Over and over again in Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh rose to the challenges, like a bright, glittering stars in the suffrage movement. Of particular note, the legislators of our Commonwealth were won 
                                over to the suffragists’ cause in no small measure due to the Pittsburgh Plan. Yes the Pittsburgh Plan.
                                It was a brilliant strategy conceived by Pittsburgh’s own Jennie Bradley Roessing, and implemented with the help of western PA suffragists and their active network across the Commonwealth. Their 
                                impact was felt across the nation. Please take a moment to consider the era they lived in. Some were wealthy, some of modest means; part of the group was educated, others were barely literate; they were a diverse bunch, white and 
                                black women; Christian and Jewish women. These women hadn’t been raised to be: But they did it. Yes, at times their knees quaked under their spindly skirts. Yes, sometimes their voices sometimes quavered. But they did it. These pages are a starting point, we hope that you will explore more about Pittsburgh’s remarkable suffragists throughout this year.

CDBG funds must be used to benefit people with low to moderate incomes. The Community Development Division is responsible for the administration of the CDBG program for the City of Pittsburgh. Serving as a catalyst for development in the City's neighborhoods, this program distributes grants for a wide range of projects which address the housing, economic, and human service needs of low and moderate income residents and neighborhoods. The City uses CDBG funds for general public improvement projects such as sidewalk repairs and demolishing vacant buildings. Funds are also awarded to local nonprofit organizations as Public Service Grants or Neighborhood Economic Development Grants. HUD has a library of resources available on their Explore CDBG page, designed to help community develpment professionals leverage grant funds effectively.

City-County Building History In 1794, the newly formed Borough of Pittsburgh established a Public Market House in the current location of Market Square. Aside from creating 
                                        the public market tradition that continues there today, this location was also home to the very first Pittsburgh Municipal Hall. As Pittsburgh 
                                        continued to grow, so would the space required for government services. The Market House quickly became obsolete and the cornerstone of a new 
                                        City Hall was laid at Smithfield Street and Oliver Avenue in May of 1869. The County, which first courthouse was also in this location moved 
                                        to its current location on Grant Street in 1836. The Smithield Street City Hall would serve until the completion of the City-County Building 
                                        in 1917. It would sit abandoned for 50 years before sold for a redevelopment in the 1950's. The first City Hall at Market Square. The second City Hall on Smithfield Street. Mayor David Lawrence strikes the first blow for the demolition of the second City Hall. In 1911, a City of Pittsburgh Commission was formed by unanimous resolution of Council for the construction of a new City Hall. The Commission, 
                                        which by 1913 had been joined by the appropriate members representing Allegheny County, employed New York architect Cass Gilbert to arrange a 
                                        competition for the design of a new municipal building. Of the 16 entries, the winning design was submitted by the firm Palmer, Hornbostel, & 
                                        Jones of New York, who were represented locally by Edward B. Lee. The plans were officially adopted on January 19, 1914, and began the 
                                        following year. The building acted as a gift to Pittsburgh to honor the 1916 Centennial of Pittsburgh's 1816 incorporation as a City. At the 
                                        March 1916 dedication ceremony, Mayor Joseph Armstrong placed a time capsule into the still under construction building. Two and a half years 
                                        later in December 1917, he would become the first Mayor to call the City-County Building a second home. The missing time capsule has yet to be 
                                        discovered. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette announces Pittsburgh's 1916 Centennial and the construction of a new City Hall. Mayor Armstrong places a newspaper in the time capsule to be buried in the City-County Building. The shovel used in the groundbreaking ceremony of the City-County Building. The City-County Building under construction in 1916. The Grand Lobby of the City-County Building, is one of the building's most beautiful spaces. The room extends the length of the building, 
                                        connecting Grant Street to Ross Street. The 30-foot wide hall is topped off by a 47-foot high barrel-vaulted ceiling. On the first floor, the 
                                        marble lined hall is flanked by a series of row offices that contain the public service offices most often visited - the County's marriage

Under Pennsylvania Earned Income Tax law, all residents of the City of Pittsburgh must have three (3%) percent of their wages withheld from their pay as Earned Income Tax. This amount is to be remitted to Jordan Tax Services. This applies whether the employer is located within or outside the City of Pittsburgh. The determining factor is the residency of the employee, not the location of the employer. If insufficient amounts are withheld by employers, City residents are required to pay the difference when EIT tax returns are filed with Jordan Tax Services. Jordan Tax Services is the agent for EIT Tax collection for the Allegheny County Central Tax District.

In calculating the earnings of self-employed persons or partners, such earnings are the sum of guaranteed payments and the lesser of net profits or net draws or distributions from the business. Passive income received by a self-employed person or a partner is not subject to tax because it is not considered “earned” income.

For employers whose employees perform work or render services partly within and partly outside of the City of Pittsburgh, the method of computing their payroll expense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh is to use the percentage of total number of working hours employed within the City of Pittsburgh compared to the total number of hours employed (within and outside) the City for each individual employee.  Detailed examples are provided in the Regulations.

This tax is collected by the provider of the amusement from patrons.  The tax due is 5% of the admission fee charged for attending any amusement in the City of Pittsburgh. An amusement can include any form of entertainment such as concerts, movies, night clubs, conventions, or sporting events. If you operate or provide any place of amusement where people must pay an established price to attend or engage in the amusement, then you are responsible for collecting the tax from patrons, filing the tax returns, and remitting the tax to the City of Pittsburgh.

Amusement Tax is imposed at the rate of 5% of the gross admission charge for the amusement venue or event.  No deductions are allowed for any costs or expenses that you incur in providing the amusement. For an amusement (entertainment) at a place where food and drink are served where there is no fixed charge for admission, the Amusement Tax will be based on 10% of the total amount paid for food and drink. For example, if a check for food and drink by a party of four amounts to $80.00, the admission charge is 10% of the total check, or $8.00. $8.00 admission charge X 5% = $ .40 Amusement Tax. Where admission is obtained to any amusement solely or partly by a donation, contribution and other monetary charge, the established price for amusement for purposes of the tax shall be twenty-five (25%) percent of the total donation, contribution and other monetary charge. When amusement is conducted at a social club or fraternal organization which also furnishes entertainment for which a separate charge is not made, the established price shall be fifty (50%) percent of the gross receipts For more information, see: What happens if you don’t pay on time?

CAREERS CONTACT US FOLLOW US GUÍA DE RESIDENTES DEPARTMENT MENU Bureau Of Animal Care & Control (AC&C) Public Safety Links Bureau of Animal Care & Control The Bureau of Animal Care & Control serves the residents of the City of Pittsburgh by providing care, control and resolution to situations dealing with domestic animals and wildlife. Love Your Wild Neighbor Public Service Announcement Video Baby Fawns Public Service Announcement Video Coyotes Public Service Announcement Video Love Dogs & Cats Public Service Announcement Video Description of Services:  The Bureau of Animal Care & Control provides assistance to Bureaus within the Department of Public Safety, other City Departments and the Allegheny County Health Department in situations involving animals, both domestic and wild. The Bureau enforces City and State codes dealing with animals; issues citations and appears in court; helps to keep our City’s parks animal-nuisance free; works with non-profit animal shelters; provides consultation to other municipalities concerning animal issues; and assists the Pennsylvania Game Commission in tracking the rabies virus. Animal Care & Control Officers capture stray animals, assist in pet/owner recovery, resolve neighbor disputes over animals, assist the elderly and physically-challenged with animal concerns, advise and teach residents of their responsibility as pet owners, advise non-pet owners of their rights, and assist in the removal of nuisance wildlife. Nuisance wildlife is defined as wildlife that causes, or is about to cause, property damage or that presents a threat to the health or safety of the community by means of disease transmission or direct attacks. The Bureau also quarantines animals, provides removal of deceased animals, and assists police and the District Attorney's office with humane investigations. Although Animal Care & Control encourages responsible pet/companion ownership there are still over 1,300 dogs and cats picked up yearly. Many are reunited with their homes through a partnership the City has with a local animal shelter. Due to the wooded mountainous geography of our City, residents share common areas with a host of wildlife (skunks, raccoons, ground hogs, foxes, coyotes, deer, turkeys, etc.) Learn more about how to share space with wildlife by visiting our Living with Wild Life page. The City offers 24 hour service. The Animal Care & Control office hours are Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Please visit our Contact Us page. Operations continue from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Friday. Saturdays and Sundays operations are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m, and on holidays, from 8 am to 4 pm. All "after hour" operations are for any emergency that a resident may have. Call the after-hours number at 412-255-2935. Responsible pet owners need to know that along with the obligation to properly feed, shelter, and care for a pet, there are laws (ordinances) to protect the animal, the pet owner, and the community. "Owner" includes every person who keeps or shelters and every person who allows an animal to be on their property (land or house) which is occupied by him or her. This means that if you are in possession of an animal, whether you own it or not - you're responsible for its care, behavior, and welfare. CITY INFORMATION City Directory

CAREERS CONTACT US FOLLOW US GUÍA DE RESIDENTES DEPARTMENT MENU City Clerk City Council Legislative Information Center Home Rule Charter What is Home Rule? With home rule, Pittsburgh will no longer have to go to the State Legislature in Harrisburg to seek permission for actions it should be able to decide on its own. In the future, home rule will allow the City to do everything not expressly forbidden by state law or the Constitution. Moreover, the new charter will establish a more flexible, efficient and responsible government. There are certain matters that the Study Commission was not allowed to change. The state law authorizing the Commission forbids any changes in pensions, benefits or working conditions now enjoyed by city employees, subjects of taxation, property assessments, eminent domain, public schools, or election laws. Therefore, this charter can only do part of the task of modernizing city government. Many other needed changes will have tocome through the General Assembly of the Commonwealth. Many essential changes, however, are made in this new charter. Particularly, it provides for a flexible, easy-to-change structure, and for improved access and response for citizens.

CAREERS CONTACT US FOLLOW US GUÍA DE RESIDENTES DEPARTMENT MENU Right to Know Policy Law Links Right To Know Policy On January 1, 2009, a new Right to Know Law (the "RTKL") took effect in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Under this statute, public records of the City of Pittsburgh are generally available to citizens who request them. The following outlines the basic provisions of the RTKL and the procedures for making a request for records: PUBLIC RECORDS The Right to Know Law defines a public record as information, regardless of physical form, which documents a transaction or activity of the City, and that is created, received or retained pursuant to law or in connection with a transaction, business or activity of the City. A record is NOT a public record if: Generally, public records are to be open for inspection or duplication in accordance with the RTKL. Records are to be provided in the medium requested if they exist in that medium. Otherwise, they are to be provided in the medium in which they exist. The RTKL does not require the City to give computer access to any requester. When responding to a request, the City is not required to create a record that does not presently exist. Nor is the City required to compile, maintain, format, or organize a record in a manner in which the City does not currently maintain, format, or organize the record. CITY INFORMATION City Directory

The financial information within this report is taken, in large part, from the City's independently audited set of financial statements. In addition to providing financial information, the PAFR provides information about Pittsburgh's demographics, elected officials and government and the Pittsburgh Promise.
