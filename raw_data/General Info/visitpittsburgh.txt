Early celebrations included reassurance among descendants, praying and gathering of remaining family members. In fact, many of the activities present at the first Juneteenth celebrations, including fishing, barbecuing and baseball, are still present today. Most importantly, the day is a time for education and self-improvement. On June 19, 2019, Pennsylvania officially designated June 19 a state holiday ‚Äì ‚ÄúJuneteenth National Freedom Day.‚Äù In August 2020, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto declared that Juneteenth will become a City holiday in 2021; and in October, Allegheny County Council made Juneteenth a county holiday beginning in 2021.

Navigation Wineries & Distilleries Discover and explore Pittsburgh's unique drinking history! In 1794, the Whiskey Rebellion was in full force because of farmers rebelling against the whisky task which in return made western Pennsylvania a hub for a lot of distilleries during that time. This changed when prohibition came into effect where it made it illegal to produce and sell alcohol.Fast forward to the year 2000, when the whole state of Pennsylvania had only one distillery. Today, there are around 70 in the state with more than a dozen of those located in Allegheny County.

Navigation Farms & Farmers Markets Pittsburgh Area Farmers' Markets and U-Pick Farms Pittsburgh food has always been rooted in tradition and fresh off the farm. As a result, farmers' markets are a well established part of Pittsburgh culture. There are more farmers' markets and community gardens per capita in Pittsburgh than in most U.S. metropolitan areas. In season, you can find one just about every day of the week in different neighborhoods. Whether it's a church parking lot, a sidewalk stand, or a tent off the side of the road, these markets sell local farm fresh produce, eggs, cheese, homemade baked goods, jams and honey. Some farmers' markets even sell Amish-made wood furniture and rugs. For a complete list of Pittsburgh area farmers' markets, click here. U-Pick Farms in Pittsburgh If you want to get a little closer to your food, try harvesting your own produce at Pittsburgh area U-Pick Farms. You'll get some exercise as well as a great big bunch of fresh produce you picked yourself. Visiting a u-pick farm is a great family experience that is both fun and educational. There's something about harvesting your own food that makes you appreciate it more. Many U-Pick farms also have on-site stores selling other ready-to-go products from their farm. Community Supported Agriculture in Pittsburgh Many Pittsburgh area residents enter in to a more formal agreement with local farmers to ensure their seasonal supply of farm fresh products; including farm fresh beef and other meats. This is a relatively new and growing trend called, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). These agreements, and the products offered, vary by farm and help local families enjoy a variety of farm fresh products while providing local farmers a profitable outlet for their harvest.

Navigation Senior Travel Pittsburgh is a great city to visit, but especially for senior travelers exploring without children. It‚Äôs a very drivable city if you have a car. Or, you can easily order an Uber or Lyft if you arrived by Amtrak. Best of all, parking is plentiful around your favorite spots. If you love art and museums, this is your town. The Andy Warhol Museum on the North Shore reflects the Pittsburgh-born artist‚Äôs life with an eccentric artistic touch. Make sure you catch a glimpse of one of his most famous pieces, Campbell‚Äôs Soup Cans. You also can view many of his personal items, including a collection of wigs. Head across town to The Frick Pittsburgh in Point Breeze to enjoy a legacy of art, history and nature. The Car and Carriage Museum, included in The Frick‚Äôs free admission, is a ride through history. Plan accordingly so you can take your time and enjoy a leisurely stroll through the mansion, the museum and garden areas. Up for more walking? Make sure you include a visit to the Strip District where you‚Äôll find a variety of shopping, including lots of black and gold merchandise, eclectic food and restaurant offerings and gift shops. Be on the lookout for The Strip Mural by artists Carley Parris and Shannon Pultz ‚Äì it‚Äôs easily viewed on Penn Ave. For those wishing to savor all the flavors of the Strip District ‚Äì or a handful of other Pittsburgh neighborhoods ‚Äì consider booking a walking food tour with ‚ÄòBurgh Bits & Bites. Sports fans are in luck in Pittsburgh! The city is home to several professional teams, including the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Penguins, and the locals are fanatical for their favorite sports teams. You can find a large area devoted to the teams at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located inside the Senator John Heinz History Museum. The Heinz History Museum pays tribute to more than the local sports teams. Here, you can learn so much about one of Pittsburgh‚Äôs most famous citizens, Mister Rogers, a national treasure. Find his monogrammed house slippers and one of his beloved red cardigans. The museum also is full of American history following the democracy of the country. When your legs need a respite from walking, rest assured there are several more relaxing ways to see the city. Book a tour on Molly‚Äôs Trolleys Pittsburgh. Not only will you visit several neighborhoods and see many of the city‚Äôs popular sites, but thanks to the fantastic tour guides, you also will learn a bit of regional history. One such nugget learned on a recent trip - ketchup wasn‚Äôt the first Heinz product produced; bottled horseradish was! Ride the Duquesne Incline up to the Mount Washington neighborhood for a spectacular view of the city. A quick ride back down will drop you off in the South Side neighborhood. Pittsburgh is widely known for its three rivers. Tour the city by water aboard the Gateway Clipper Fleet. Sit back and relax on the Three Rivers Sightseeing Cruise, which allows visitors a close view of the Downtown skyline and several of the city‚Äôs 446 bridges. And, the sunset cruises are a great option for a romantic night out. Speaking of those bridges, many of them are easily walkable, connecting Downtown to several of Pittsburgh‚Äôs 90 unique neighborhoods. In fact, the Sixth Street Bridge, commonly known as the Clemente Bridge, directly takes you from Downtown to PNC Park, home of the Pirates. Consider extending your Pittsburgh visit with a daytrip to the Laurel Highlands, where you can visit two of Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äôs most iconic homes, Fallingwater and Kentuck Knob. Visiting these residences is like stepping back in time, as the d√©cor reflects the decade each house was built. When available, make sure you book a guided tour, as they provide an insider‚Äôs look at Mr. Wright‚Äôs thought processes, as well as the homeowners‚Äô. Visitors have their pick of comfortable lodging options in Pittsburgh, including several that are housed in historical buildings, like the Drury Plaza Hotel Pittsburgh Downtown which is a beautiful renovation of the Federal Reserve Bank building. Many pieces remain from the original bank including vault doors estimated to weigh 34 tons each. The property is located Downtown and within easy walking distance of many attractions, restaurants and Union Station. The Omni William Penn Hotel also makes for a lovely stay. The iconic hotel is home to Lawrence Welk‚Äôs original bubble machine. Plus, it‚Äôs also where Bob Hope proposed to his wife, Delores.

Navigation Ultimate Steelers Gameweek Guide Steelers Nation! In Pittsburgh for the big game? We've got the scoop on how to enjoy the ultimate sports city! Nicknamed the City of Champions, it's no surprise that Pittsburgh is the ultimate football destination. If you're reading this, we're assuming you'll be in town for a few days and have lots to pack your itinerary with. Whether you're visiting from out-of-town or you're a local with season tickets, check out our Pittsburgh guide especially for football fans! Experience Steelers History Explore 90 years of Steelers history at the newly opened Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, located near the B Suite gate at Acrisure Stadium. This 10,000-square-foot exhibit walks visitors through every decade of Steelers history with never-before-seen artifacts and interactive exhibits that let you become part of Steelers history. Or, tackle your way through Pittsburgh football history at the Senator John Heinz History Center's Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum! Relive iconic Pittsburgh moments such as the Immaculate Reception, try on a Super Bowl ring, learn more about Myron Cope's Official Terrible Towel and take a picture with the Terrible Fan. Featuring more than 70 interactive exhibits, this is the ultimate museum for any sports lover. Go Behind The Scenes Experience Steelers football up-close during an Acrisure Stadium Tour. The tours take fans on-field, in the locker rooms, through the Great Hall, including the Hall of Honor, and more. Tickets are only $10 per person for the Stadium Highlight Tour, but true fans may want to splurge on the Game Day Tours for unprecedented access to Steelers Game Day! Get Some Gear Need some new Steelers gear? Take a trip to Pittsburgh's authentic Strip District neighborhood for any and everything Steelers. Yinzers in the Burgh is a notable Pittsburgh sports store, filled with everything from Steelers onesies to a huge variety of Terrible Towels, Steelers hats, cold weather gear, jerseys and so much more. You can also find street vendors that sell various low-cost black and gold apparel. Looking for more general black-and-gold apparel? Check out these local shops: Take the Burgh Bus All the fun of making jokes about Cleveland, on wheels! Join comedian Matt Light on the Burgh Bus as you tailgate through distinct Pittsburgh neighborhoods, wave your Terrible Towel, compete at Pittsburgh trivia and much more on this truly one-of-a-kind tour. A post shared by The Burgh Bus (@burghbus) Ride The Incline and Walk Around The Point Have a day or two to kill before the game? Come visit these spots. Both attractions are often featured during NFL broadcasts of home Steelers games. The Duquesne Incline specifically has a great view of Pittsburgh during the fall and winter months. The Point is a go-to walk to take in pretty much anything you can see downtown, and it's an easy walk from there, over the bridge and into our North Shore where the Steelers play! Catch Other Pittsburgh Sports Not only does Pittsburgh come to life on Steelers Sundays, but our passionate fan base also brings that same energy to other teams throughout the city. In September (and hopefully October) the Pittsburgh Pirates season overlaps with the Steelers, making it possible to see both teams in a weekend at two world-renowned stadiums. The same is true across two rivers at Highmark Stadium to support the Pittsburgh Riverhounds pro soccer team! From mid-October on, the Pittsburgh Penguins NHL team also plays in our Uptown neighborhood at PPG Paints Arena. Or, check out the Pitt Panthers who also play at Acrisure in ACC action! Pro Tip: Look at all our sports team schedules before you visit to see who else might be able to see while you're in town! Head Under our Friday Night Lights If you live and breathe football, you're in luck. Pittsburgh and the surrounding region is a hotbed of high school football activity, with powerhouse teams, NFL Draft-caliber talent and rivalries that pack the stadium. Find schedules of our games on local news sites or through the WPIAL to see our own Friday Night Lights. A post shared by Aaron Caldwell (@aac_creative) Go On a Brew Tour Beer and football have always went hand-in-hand, but if you're in town for a Steelers game you're also lucky enough to be in one of the top craft beer cities in the country. Follow the Pittsburgh Brewers Guild for pre-made trails that let you explore a unique neighborhood and sampling their best suds. I'd recommend starting with their North Shore Trail, which allows you to sip six of my favorite brews all throughout our stadium district where the Steelers play. If you have time to venture outside of the city, book a tour at Pittsburgh Brewing Co., the home of I.C. Light and Iron City Beer, for a behind-the-scenes tour of this AI-enhanced, state-of-the-art brewery. Eat Like a Local Food is serious business in Pittsburgh. We love our regional delicacies from pierogis and french fry-filled sandwiches to gobs and chipped ham. As our city grew and populations shifted, you can now find international cuisine, fine dining and Pittsburgh staples all on the same street. My favorite way to enjoy all of our local favorites combines both our dining scene and the Steelers. Follow our guide to the Strip District and walk around to our various markets and restaurants (and don't forget some local beer), then bring your bounty to the lots outside Acrisure Stadium for the ultimate tailgate. Visit The Great One While Pittsburgh is no stranger to hall of famers and all stars, we have an entire museum dedicated to Roberto Clemente, housed in a historic firehouse and full of memorabilia from The Great One himself. Make sure to add on the wine tasting at the Clemente Museum for the full experience and keep an eye out for celebrity gear not just from Clemente but other baseball and Pittsburgh sports legends as you explore. Ok, we've went over the plays and you should have your itinerary in hand. Time to break this huddle. We'll see you out there exploring the city and inside Acrisure Stadium screaming for the black and gold alongside us.

Navigation A Guide to Acrisure Stadium for Steelers Fans In town for a big game? We've got the scoop on how to enjoy a Steelers game in the ultimate sports town! Nicknamed the City of Champions, it's no surprise that Pittsburgh is a top football destination. Whether you're visiting from out-of-town or haven't been to a game in a while, check out our Pittsburgh Steelers and Acrisure Stadium guide for every football fan. Where do the Steelers play their home games? Acrisure Stadium is the celebrated football stadium, situated in the North Shore neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that proudly serves as the home of the Steelers. How to get to Acrisure Stadium Public TransportationSince parking on the North Shore near the stadium is reserved and pre-sold, it's often easier to park and ride to the stadium using other options. Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) offers light rail service on the T and city buses for fans coming from Downtown Pittsburgh and surrounding suburbs. You can find more information on how to get to the stadium on the PRT website. Riverboat ShuttlesThe Gateway Clipper also offers gameday riverboat rides to the stadium and is my personal favorite way to get to the game. Park at Station Square, grab your tickets and enjoy your ride around the Point with raucous, fun-loving fans before getting dropped off right at the stadium. Find more information about riverboat shuttles here. Driving & Parking InformationIf you are planning to drive and park near the stadium, visit ALCO parking for a helpful interactive guide to parking on the North Shore. Where‚Äôs the best place to tailgate before a Steelers game? The tailgating scene in Pittsburgh is as fun as the Steelers game itself! You can find tailgaters grilling and getting amped up with the rest of Steelers Nation in designated parking lots. The parking lots open five hours prior to kick-off and you can find more tailgating information and regulations here. If you want to tailgate but don't have a group to join up with, the Stage AE Tailgate Zone is perfect for you! Admission is free, and the event has live music, giant TVs, food and drink specials, along with prizes and autographed items you can win. Where to Eat near Acrisure Stadium? The North Shore, home to Acrisure Stadium, is filled with plenty of bars and restaurants for all football fans. Shorty's Pins & Pints, Southern Tier, Tom's Watch, Burgatory and Bar Louie are popular spots to grab a craft beer pre- or post-game that are walkable to Acrisure. Even if you don't have a ticket, these locales are some of the best places to watch the game outside of Acrisure Stadium, promising a lively atmosphere and passionate fans cheering on every play to go with your food and drink. What else to do near Acrisure Stadium? There's so much to do in the North Shore we did a whole blog about everything to explore pre- or post-game, from stadium tours and museum visits to kayaking, duckpin bowling and shopping for the latest Steelers merch. Browse the map below to see everything going on nearby in the North Shore. Just double check times and hours of operation which can sometimes change on Steelers Sundays.

More Cool Things to Do Near Acrisure Stadium Don't Forget to Brush Up On Your Pittsburgh Steelers Trivia What is The Terrible Towel?Created by Steelers radio broadcaster, Myron Cope in 1975, the Terrible Towel is easily one of the most recognizable symbols in the NFL and waving it during games has become a revered tradition. Towels can be purchased in stadium or at sports stores around the North Shore. What is the song played during the fourth quarter?When the Steelers need a big stop in the fourth quarter, the song Renegade by Styx resonates throughout Acrisure Stadium. Playing the song is a tradition that's equally important for fans as it is for players and represents Pittsburgh's defensive strength in the fourth quarter. What‚Äôs the meaning behind the Steelers logo?While it's widely known that the Steelers are named for Pittsburgh's rich steel history, few recognize the meaning behind the logo. Each of the hypocycloids represents one of the three materials used to make steel. Yellow represents coal, red is for iron ore and steel scrape is illustrated with blue. Why do Steelers fans chant ‚ÄúHere We Go Steelers?‚ÄùDuring games, you'll hear fans chanting "Here We Go, Steelers!" While it seems like a simple chant, there's some history behind this one too. ‚ÄúHere We Go,‚Äù originally written by Rodger Wood and recorded in 1994, was and still is intended as a Steelers fight song. When should I head to a game this season?Take a look at the Steelers‚Äô 2024 schedule here! The Steelers will be playing 9 regular season and 1 preseason game at Acrisure Stadium from August-January this year.

Navigation 5 Reasons Why the 2024 Backyard Brawl Will Continue to Live Up to the Hype One of College Football's Best Rivalries Returns to Acrisure Stadium on Sept. 14 Only 75 miles separates the University of Pittsburgh and West Virginia University, and since 1895 they have annually met on the gridiron for regional bragging rights. In 2011, the sad breakup of Big East football put this series on a hiatus. Two years ago, the Backyard Brawl made a triumphant return when the Panthers and Mountaineers opened the 2022 College Football season in front of a sellout crowd on the North Shore. On Saturday, Sept 14, 2024 these proud football programs will return to Acrisure Stadium to brawl for the lead in the new edition of this electric series. We break down why this game will continue to live up to the hype of this historic rivalry. 1) Looking for an Edge in the New Series With the new series tied at one win for each team, this is a critical game for the programs to take a lead in this current 4 game series. On Sept. 1, 2022, the victory lights were turned on in Oakland after an exciting 38-31 Thursday Night win. Two touchdowns from Rodney Hammond and a stellar 56-yard interception returned for a touchdown by MJ Devonshire fueled the Panthers as they threw the first punch in the new series. On Sept. 16, 2023 the Mountaineers hit back with a controlling 17-6 victory in Morgantown. WVU‚Äôs revenge win was carried by a great defensive performance with three interceptions as well as 102 yards and a touchdown from CJ Donaldson. This season‚Äôs matchup during Week 3 of the 2024 season will be the third game of a contracted four game series. After 2025, this series will take another hiatus until the 2029 season. In a heated rivalry like the Backyard Brawl, every result will be magnified. And the fact that this series won‚Äôt be back in Pittsburgh for a while after this game will raise the stakes even more. 2) Something to Prove The hometown Pittsburgh Panthers are coming off a disappointing 3-9 (2-6 ACC) season. This was the worst win total of Pat Narduzzi‚Äôs time as Pitt Head Coach. The highlight of the Panthers‚Äô season was a 38-21 win over the then-undefeated Louisville Cardinals in one of the best upsets of the 2023 College Football season. This was only the second losing season of Narduzzi‚Äôs tenure that is entering year number 10. Despite this, Pitt was picked to finish 13 out of 17 teams in this year‚Äôs ACC preseason poll. Luckily for the Panthers, this program is very used to overcoming doubters (don‚Äôt forget their 2021 season). And, they will be very eager to prove them wrong once again and redeem last season‚Äôs letdown, starting with defending their home against their greatest rivals. The West Virginia Mountaineers finished 2023 with a 9-4 (6-3 Big 12) record. Despite being picked to finish last in 2023 Big XII Conference preseason poll, they blew their peers‚Äô expectations out of the water and had the most successful season of Head Coach Neal Brown‚Äôs tenure. In addition to their victory in last year‚Äôs Backyard Brawl, the Mountaineers also took a signature win in the Duke‚Äôs Mayo Bowl when they trounced the North Carolina Tar Heels 30-10 in Charlotte. WVU enters this season with very high expectations. They were picked to finish seventh in this season‚Äôs 16-team Big XII preseason poll, received votes in the AP National Preseason poll, and return a high upside QB in Garrett Green. All these reasons will give the traveling Mountaineer fans hope for a win in enemy territory, and to prove that they can earn national recognition this season. 3) Hungry Newcomers and Experienced Veterans The Pitt Offense is now led by a new Offensive Coordinator named Kade Bell, who previously designed one of the highest scoring offenses last year at the ‚ÄúFCS‚Äù level for Western Carolina. With a new OC also comes a new QB as Eli Holstein will be the likely starter. Holstein is a redshirt freshman who spent last season at Alabama without making an appearance. He is regarded as having a high ceiling as he was one of the high school football recruits in the nation in 2023, and will be hungry to prove himself at this level. The offense will also star returning Tight End Gavin Bartholemew and Running Back Desmond Reid, while also returning four O-line starters from last season and clutch Kicker Ben Sauls. They will have a tall task scoring on the West Virginia defense, which returns a great Safety duo in Aubrey Burks and Anthony Wilson, along with Defensive End Sean Martin. They will be bolstered by four key transfers, most notably former Duquesne Corner Ayden Garnes. Mountaineer fans are very excited about this year‚Äôs QB/RB duo of Garrett Green and CJ Donaldson. Greene threw for 2,406 yards and 16 touchdowns last season, while adding 772 yards and 13 rushing touchdowns. Those great numbers came despite him missing most of last year‚Äôs Backyard Brawl with an injury. CJ Donaldson was a key piece of the offense in the last two matchups vs. Pitt and has 19 touchdowns over his past two seasons overall. West Virginia‚Äôs Offensive Line has recently been a big strength of their team, and this year‚Äôs unit will be led by preseason all Big XII selection Wyatt Milum. They will match up against a tough Pitt defense that will have a mix of old and new faces. Safety Donovan McMillion should be the star of this defense, he led the team in tackles last season with 105. Safety Javon McIntyre and Linebacker Brandon George are two other important returning veterans. Defensive lineman Nick James and Nate Matlack, along with Linebacker transfer Keye Thompson are among some important transfers hoping to make a name for themselves in this game. Both programs are filled with players who have had the experience of playing in this high stakes rivalry, but they have also brought in new players that will be anxious to make their mark on this game. 4) Highlight Plays Since the series resumed in 2022, both games have been defined by clutch plays. One interesting detail about the past couple matchups is the best play for both teams‚Äô wins have been on the defensive side of the ball. In 2021, Pitt‚Äôs MJ Devonshire, from Aliquippa, cemented himself in Pitt greatness when he picked off a deflected pass and took it to the endzone for the go-ahead touchdown. The play sent the stadium and the Panther Pitt Student Section into a frenzy. We‚Äôll make an argument that the play of the game in last year‚Äôs Backyard Brawl was from Aubrey Burks. The now-senior safety picked off a Phil Jurkovec pass in the second quarter and brought it back to the 7-yard line to set up an important touchdown. The past two matchups have been a great indicator that this game will bring the best out of the players, especially on defense. A post shared by ESPN College Football (@espncfb) 5) Great Atmosphere, With No Love Lost It‚Äôs hard to believe that the most attended football game ever in Acrisure Stadium was not a Steelers game, but the 2022 return of the Bayard Brawl with 70,622 fans. As awesome as these players and coaches are, what really drives this rivalry is the fans. West Virginia fans have proved that they aren‚Äôt intimidated of the away trip up to Pittsburgh. But Pitt fans proved two years ago that they can answer the call to help their players defend home turf. In a rivalry that transcends into other sports like Men‚Äôs Basketball, the resumption of this series has been a huge boost to these programs and their fans. Everything great about this series, and about college football really, trickles down to the energy from the fans, during the games. And the passion of both of these fanbases can push their players to make this the best Backyard Brawl yet! Author's Note: This series is everything great about college football. I attended the Backyard Brawl return game two years ago in Panther Pitt, and it was one of the best nights of my life. College football is unique because of the unmatched passion that these matchups bring. Thank you to everyone for reading!

Navigation Cheer on the Pittsburgh Riverhounds Add a trip to Highmark Stadium to your 2024 Pittsburgh Itinerary We all know the Steelers', Pirates' and Penguins' pedigrees in Pittsburgh. But what if I told you one of the best nights out in the city happens in a stadium on the south side of the city, complete with scenic views, exciting games and a friendly, high-energy atmosphere? Enter the Pittsburgh Riverhounds, the city's professional soccer team. Before you exit the blog and try to tell me soccer is boring, hear me out. The Hounds (as they're affectionately known) play playoff caliber soccer on the pitch, but the entire game experience from tailgating to after-the-game activities are geared to keep adults and kids happy. Follow along with my Insider's Guide to the Hounds for my tips on what's new for the 2024 season, the best places to sit, the food to grab and some info you'll only be able to find in this blog. I've been following the Riverhounds for years, and can confidently say that your ticket to the game is one of the best values in sports anywhere in the country. What's New for 2024 Something that keeps me coming back to the Hounds every year is that there's always something new and exciting happening for games so that no two evenings are alike. Here's just a few highlights of the promotions happening in 2024: A New Look for 2024 I've collected a number of Hounds t-shirts and jerseys throughout the year, but the new kit for 2024 was an automatic must-buy. Pictured here are the all-new home kit, fittingly called the Three Rivers and emblazoned with an iconic gold bridge with a design I've not seen from any other sports team. The away kit, called Steel, is no less striking with a gold base design and grey accents. Fans can grab these exclusive new fits from apparel experts Charly online. Affordable Family Fun Between the concessions, tickets and merch, going to a sporting event lately can quickly become expensive. Thankfully, there's no $18 cotton candy at Highmark Stadium. The Riverhounds make every effort to keep the cost of tickets and concessions low, making this sport accessible for fans to see live. Single game tickets start at $20 and parking is cheap and plentiful at lots and garages on that side of the city. This year, fans can even pre-pay for parking passes in the main lot to take all the stress out of game day. Let's talk atmosphere. Hounds games are programmed with kids in mind, and the fan experience is equally accommodating. You'll be sitting next to other families, local soccer teams and fellow fans, so kids are always welcome here! While there's a lot of cheering, the vibe is positive and even the other team's fans are here to have a good time. There's plenty for kids to do at the stadium, too, even if they aren't as into the game. Head to the area behind the Supporters section to kick a soccer ball around with new friends and jump around in a bounce house to get out some energy. After the final whistle, stick around for the post-game autograph session when kids can meet their favorite players or just run around on the field. What to Eat and Drink If you've read my other sports blogs, you know my top concern for any sporting event is what I'm going to eat. Luckily, the Riverhounds understand what their fans want and provide a ton of tasty options that won't break the bank. New for 2024: Highmark Stadium is now the first in Pittsburgh to carry Crumbl Cookies! Check out the Tailgate Zone and Kid Zone for Oreo crumb cake, milk chocolate chip, confetti and snickerdoodle! Also new for this year is the addition of Stateside Vodka products including their refreshing Surfside seltzers. Even better, the fan fave pizza logs are now on the menu full-time. You'll also find conventional concession stand items at stands dotted around the stadium, but keep a special eye out for: Where to Sit I know people like to say this old clich√©, but there's truly not a bad seat in the house at Highmark Stadium. The best viewing experience is sitting as close to the middle of the field and as high up as possible, giving you the best view of not only the game but also the city as trains buzz past and let out a friendly puff of steam midgame. If your love of the beautiful game can't be contained, you'll find your outlet in the Supporters Section. This high-energy end of the stadium is where the Steel Army resides, drumming, leading chants throughout the game and setting off smoke during the frenzy of a goal celebration. My kids now demand that we sit there for every game and yell and laugh along. Want to bring a group? I've had a blast with bachelor parties and work events in their club suites and the party deck, but the top option here is the I.C. Light Corner Kick Suite. This shipping container-turned-luxury suite gives up to 40 guests seats right on the field just feet from the action, and the viewing deck on top of the Box is the most unique view in pro sports. Tickets The Hounds make it easy to get tickets online, at the box office or at 412-865-GOAL for single games, season tickets and other options. My only recommendation here is that if you plan on going to several games this year, grab their flexbook. You get 11 tickets for the price of 10 and can use them however you want per game, whether you end up going solo or bringing the whole fam. Join the Steel Army Ready to become a true superfan of the Hounds? Consider joining the Steel Army, the independent supporters group for the team! This group not only brings the energy to the home games and tail gates, but helps organize trips and watch parties for the rest of the schedule. What I love about the Steel Army is how welcoming they are for new members. Feel free to walk right into their tailgate and say hello, and within five minutes you'll have a burger in hand and have met five new friends. Things to Do Nearby The fun doesn't stop when the game is over. It's easy to make a trip to see the Riverhounds and Highmark Stadium into an all-day trip. The stadium is located right at the edge of Station Square, a 1.2 mile stretch of great dining and inventive ways to explore the city. Take an ebike tour of the city with Adam Solar Rides or see the Square via horse drawn carriage at Mike's Carriage Service. Station Square is also home to the Mon Incline and the Gateway Clipper, two of the most iconic ways to take in the city via funicular and riverboat. Got some insider info to share? Want to meet me for a pint at the game? Shoot me an email or come say hello in the Supporters Section as Pittsburgh becomes #Houndtahn every home game.

==================================================

Navigation How to Ride the Pittsburgh Inclines Inclines, commonly known as Funiculars Railways, can be found all over the world and throughout history. It's a question we get asked all the time. So, we're giving you the low-down on going up. These railways are designed to transport people and cargo up and down steep slopes. And if there is one thing Pittsburgh has, it's steep slopes. You've probably noticed the iconic Pittsburgh Inclines that make our skyline so unique. The Difference Between Pittsburgh's Two Inclines The Duquesne Incline (pronounced "doo-KANE") has red cars and is visible from The Point, while The Monongahela Incline (commonly called "The Mon Incline") has yellow cars and can be seen from the South Shore. Duquesne Incline1197 W. Carson St.
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219 Monongahela Incline8 Grandview Ave., Port Authority of Allegheny County
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15211 Incline History Originally opened in the 1870s to service those who lived on Mount Washington, the two inclines that remain in use are the last of four that served the Mt. Washington area. Today, they have become more than just a means of transportation. They are still used by local commuters to enter downtown, but they have evolved into our favorite way to show off the city skyline. A post shared by Brent MacLean (@eggosmith) Frequently Asked Questions How much are incline tickets? Both inclines cost $2.50 one way. The Mon Incline is $3.50 for a roundtrip ticket, and Duquesne Incline $5 roundtrip with certain discounts for children and senior citizens. Tickets can be purchased at the upper or lower station for both inclines. The Monongahela Incline will accept credit cards, but the Duquesne Incline is exact cash only. Can I Use A Connect Card to Ride the Incline? The inclines are public transportation, so Pittsburgh Regional Transit Connect Cards work to pay for a trip as well. If you don't have a Connect Card, the Mon Incline will accept credit cards, but the Duquesne Incline is exact cash only. Pro Tip: Use the PRT App on your smartphone to buy your Incline tickets. On the App, tickets are $2.75 and valid for unlimited trips for 3 hours total on both Inclines. When are the inclines open? The inclines are open 365 days a year and run approximately every 5 minutes. Hours are: Finding the Inclines To find these historic landmarks, cross the Monongahela river (the one south of Downtown) by either the Smithfield Street or Fort Pitt Bridge and enter Pittsburgh‚Äôs South Shore. You will find the lower stations of both inclines where you can purchase ride tickets. Which Incline Is Better? The two inclines both scale the side of Mount Washington and both have equally stunning views. We can't tell you which one is better, because we love them both so much! You really can't go wrong with either choice. A post shared by Dave DiCello (@davedicello) Things to Do Near The Monongahela Incline Visiting Mount Washington and our Inclines are way more than a great view. The Monongahela Incline lower station is located on East Carson Street near the Smithfield Bridge in Station Square. It is surrounded by restaurants, shops and entertainment. Here, you can park and hop on the Incline to enjoy the stunning city skyline as you rise to Grandview Avenue. At the upper station on Mt. Washington, you an enjoy scenic lookout platforms or enjoy a walk along Shiloh St. to enjoy DiFiore's ice cream with the kids or a nice lunch at Redbeard's or Coughlin's Law. Things to Do Near The Duquesne Incline The Duquesne Incline is located down the street on W Carson Street just west of the Fort Pitt Bridge in view of Point State Park and has a provided parking lot. This incline carries you to an Observation Deck that USA Today Weekend Magazine described as one of the ‚Äú10 most beautiful views in America.‚Äù Once you get to the top, you'll find more than an Instagram-worthy vie. Both upper incline stations also provide historical exhibits to browse through while waiting between rides. And why not make a day of it? Strolling around Mt Washington is a great way to spend an afternoon. Be sure to check out some of the awesome dining options! Pro Tip: Sit at the front of the cable car for the best view of the city. ‚¨áÔ∏è A post shared by Jimmy Roberts (@iamjimroberts) What to Expect Your first ride on a historic funicular might be surprising and exciting.

==================================================

Navigation Pittsburgh Fall Date Ideas Cozy up with that special someone on these fall-themed date nights It's finally fall! If you're in need of a spooky-, pumpkin spice- or harvest-themed date night idea, Pittsburgh has you covered. There's only so much time before the fall festivities turn into reindeer games, so make the most out of fall with these Pittsburgh date night ideas. Hayrides and Pumpkin Patches Pittsburgh is surrounded with farmers markets, and there's no better time to visit than the fall. Head to Trax Farms, Soergels Orchards, or Shenots (to name a few) for the ultimate fall-time date. Pittsburgh offers plenty of festivals to carve a pumpkin, get ‚Äúlost‚Äù in a corn maze or go on a hayride. If you are not sure which one to check out, take a look at our Fall Festivals Guide Hold Me (For Dear Life) Date Night Not for the weak-hearted, Pittsburgh is a top spot for haunts and the go-to escape for haunted house enthusiasts. This date night will test your relationship (and survival skills) as you enter Pittsburgh's ultimate haunted houses, including Hundred Acres Manor bringing the screams, or Zombies of the Corn which arms you with a paintball gun and lets you fight back against the zombie horde. Related: Halloween Events in Pittsburgh Phantom Fall Fest If you're an adventure-seeker or just a kid at heart, you'll want to explore Phantom Fall Fest at Kennywood. Come early and ride the Phantom's Revenge and other scream-inducing rides, then stick around after dark for phantoms stalking you through haunted houses and scare zones! This is the perfect date night complete with white-knuckle roller coasters, devilishly good food and spine-tingling fun. For Horror Film Lovers Pittsburgh's horror heritage is unmatched. It's where zombie movies first made their mark, bursting out of their graves and onto the scene with Pittsburgh filmmaker George Romero's Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. Plan a zombie-infested date night seeking out filming locations before binging these made in PGH flicks. If you can't get enough of scary movies, then head straight to Bierport bottle shop and Rowhouse cinema for date night. Bierport's taproom is now open seven days a week, so find a new favorite (bonus for going local), then bring it to the other side of the building into Rowhouse for your horror film of choice. DIY Fall Candles There's nothing like filling your house with the sweet smell of fall. At Mix Candle Co. in Pittsburgh, you can create your very own custom candle. You start out by selecting your scents with the expert candle makers and then proceed with making the candle. This is a great way to start your date night and, while your candle is drying, you can pop over to any of the surrounding Lawrenceville bars or restaurants. A post shared by Mix Candle Co (@mixcandleco) Makers Activities If the candle and paint date night ideas are pass√© for you, don't worry. Pittsburgh has tons of ways to stay active and create together so you go home with something truly one-of-a-kind. Take a jewelry making or wood class with Contemporary Craft, create your own custom scents with Galimard, forge a ring with the expert blacksmiths at The Barefoot Forge or sign up for a Make-It-Now workshop at Pittsburgh Glass Center to take home coasters, cups and even blown glass pumpkins! It's Showtime Sure, summer is great, but fall is when the Cultural District really comes to life! Our fall 2024 season of shows includes the PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh productions of Hamilton, & Juliet and MJ the Musical, plus productions from the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Pittsburgh Opera, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Liberty Magic and more! Add in national touring comedians and immersive theatre options, and this is the best time of the year to attend a show. FYF: Find Your Festival I'll be honest, I plan my date night activities right from our fall festivals page. Seemingly every weekend there is something new and different to enjoy including pumpkin festivals, Pittsburgh Irish Festival, fall foliage cruises and so much more. Find somewhere to eat and a place to grab a drink afterward, and planning your date night takes less than five minutes for a guaranteed good time. Get Thrifty The joy of discovery is the reason why thrifting has become such a trendy thing to do in Pittsburgh. You never know what store might hold the perfect piece that's been missing from your wardrobe. Luckily, we developed our guide to thrifting in the city to help you find the best bargains, upcycled clothing and eco-friendly creative surplus and supplies stores. Picnic in the Park Another reason I love Pittsburgh so much: You don't need to spend a ton on tickets to have a good time. Slow things down and enjoy a date night at one of the parks surrounding the city, taking plenty of stops for photos and a blanket for snuggling. Better yet, fill a picnic basket with some of your favorite Pittsburgh foods to snack on as you watch the leaves change. Take a Walk Around Phipps Phipps Botanical Gardens is a great spot to walk around with your special someone and see the beautiful fall flowers. Nothing in Pittsburgh adjusts to the seasons like Phipps! Opening Oct. 5, 2024, see their Fall Flower Show: Rhythm and Blooms with magnificent, music-inspired displays of chrysanthemums. Be sure to pause a moment at the Garden Railroad as their new display Movie Magic opens that same day with whimsical scenes that will transport you to the big screen. Pittsburgh Sports, Here We Go For our couples out there that like watching sports, a Pittsburgh Penguins hockey game is a great option. Pens games are exciting, vibrant and capture the magic of a fall day or night in Downtown. College Students: don‚Äôt forget to use Student Rush! If hockey isn't your game, the end of the Pirates and Riverhounds seasons collides with the beginning of Steelers and Pitt Panthers football seasons during fall, making the hardest part of date night getting tickets to these high-energy events. Make a Fall Beer Tour Pittsburgh's breweries and beer-centric are celebrated throughout the year, but fall is always an ideal time to discover that new brewery together. Pittsburgh neighborhoods have great breweries around every corner, and fall means it's time for festive new releases like pumpkin stouts, brown ales, porters, stouts and much more along with Oktoberfest celebrations at seemingly every location. Follow our beer map and plan your route for fall flavors. Dinner and a View Pittsburgh has so many great restaurants and places to take in a nice view, why not combine that into one night? Go to a North Shore restaurant and walk the river trail, or from Market Square to the Point, or even from Station Square up the incline to Mt Washington! There are endless combinations to try around the city. Related Blogs Autumn Hikes, Bikes, Runs &¬†Fun!

Navigation Penguins, Penguins, Penguins Meet Them. Feed Them. Cheer Them On. They‚Äôre adorable! They put on a good show. And they check their foes into the boards on their way to score goals? There‚Äôs a reason we have a passion for penguins here in Pittsburgh, and we‚Äôve rounded up our favorite ways to get in on the flocking fun. The National Aviary Right in the center of The National Aviary in Pittsburgh‚Äôs Northside is Penguin Point, a spectacular habitat featuring African penguins. Guests have a 360-degree view of Penguin Point as these birds dive and waddle inches away from you. Better yet, let your kids head through tubes further into the habitat that end in see-through domes putting children in the center of the fun. Want to get even closer? Book a Penguin Encounter where you and a small group get a chance to touch a penguin's waterproof back feathers as you learn more about the colony and take unforgettable photos with your new feathered friends. From April-November you can even gear up and help hand-feed a colony of African penguins yourself! Both experiences can be bought online along with your ticket. Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium While the Pittsburgh Zoo contains more than 8,000 amazing animals throughout its sprawling acreage, the biggest crowds will always be plopped right in front of the penguin habitat. Guests can get right up to the glass to see Macaroni (with their signature golden feathers on their heads) and Gentoo penguins play, swim and feed throughout the year. Saturdays and Sundays during the winter months, the zoo takes advantage of the colder temps with Penguins on Parade as guests line the pathway for a picture-perfect procession of penguins around the aquarium. Be sure to get there early for the best spot; this event is extremely popular. And, if you‚Äôre not near the Burgh and missing these playful guys, you can even watch a live penguin cam daily to keep tabs on your favorites. Pittsburgh Penguins at PPG Paints Arena Ok, so these aren‚Äôt the same cute little animals as the rest, but a Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League game at PPG Paints Arena is still one of the most exciting nights out you can have in Pittsburgh. With a diehard fanbase cheering on the black and gold, electric energy from an unmatched stadium experience and a Stanley Cup champion-led team on the ice, there‚Äôs plenty to enjoy when it‚Äôs hockey night. Keep a lookout for Iceburgh, their penguin mascot, for antics as he slides down railings, poses for pics and tosses out prizes to fans.

==================================================

Navigation The East End‚Äôs Jackworth Ginger Beer puts Pittsburgh on the map with a Pennsylvania first Did you know that Pittsburgh is home to Pennsylvania's first ginger beer brewery? It's called Jackworth Ginger Beer, and only a few such establishments exist in the country. Co-owners Jackworth Smith and Tyler Lewis are thrilled to be a part of this unique beverage‚Äôs revival, and they‚Äôre not taking their role lightly as the first in the state. At their brewery, they also make non-alcoholic ginger beer to offer guests, since it feels important that there‚Äôs something for everyone to enjoy inside their welcoming space. Joining A Craft Beverage Corridor The pair of friends (since college) say it‚Äôs been a journey getting to where they are with the business, though it‚Äôs a very ‚Äúlived-in‚Äù idea they‚Äôve been working on for years and years. They love being part of their East End community situated on the edge of Larimer, where a craft beverage corridor of sorts has emerged. Goodlander Cocktail Brewery (a first-of-its-kind venue specializing in low-waste draft beverages) can be found directly across the street, and hip KLVN Coffee Lab a stone‚Äôs throw away. East End Brewing Company is just around the corner, too. Jackworth‚Äôs flagship product ‚Äî which happens to be both vegan and gluten-free ‚Äî is a naturally fermented ginger beer that uses only the freshest ingredients (organic ginger from Peru, cane sugar, lemon and water) and gets fermented to 5% ABV. The owners claim that the taste, crisp and refreshing with a subtle lingering spiciness, is representative of our city ‚Äî ‚Äúbold and refreshing.‚Äù Finding A Special Address For Smith, the venue location feels extra meaningful. He grew up 10 blocks away in Point Breeze, and he was named after his great grandfather who used to drive the 76 Hamilton streetcar line along this very road. The industrial setting feels perfect for their needs, and they‚Äôve fully outfitted the rather compact space with reclaimed treasures from nearby Construction Junction (like ornate windows from a gutted mansion, marble from an old bank, even a holy water fountain). A patio on the building‚Äôs side has proven perfect for events they‚Äôve hosted from chill music gatherings to a ‚Äúmeet your maker‚Äù guest bartender series that allows local talents to show off cocktails incorporating ginger beer. (As a bonus, mixologists often want to purchase products to take back for creations made at their own bars and restaurants.) While ginger beer was once an afterthought, Jackworth is helping it get nudged back into the spotlight. Discovering the Beverage‚Äôs Rich History While Smith and Lewis make it clear they surely didn‚Äôt invent the beverage, they‚Äôre committed to exploring it. In 2017 Smith moved back to his hometown after living in various cities around the country, knowing he wanted to pursue this dream. He had often wondered why ginger beer was called just that, when it was in fact an alcohol-free soda used in cocktails like Moscow mules or sipped on its own. After some research he learned that actual ginger beer had been wildly popular with American folks pre-Prohibition when thousands of breweries existed; after Prohibition, however, it made a return as a non-alcoholic ginger ale alternative. So over a decade ago, Smith began diving into century-old recipes and teaching himself about fermentation, perfecting his products as he went (working roughly off cider and mead recipes to guide the way). He says he expanded his knowledge through books, podcasts and ‚Äúmaking a lot of really bad batches‚Äù of ginger beer along the way. Today the German wine tanks work their magic in the back of the brewery, while a full bar up front serves exclusively Pennsylvania-made beer, liquor, wine, and cider, and features classic cocktails featuring PA spirits alongside ginger beer-based cocktails. Though they plan to experiment with new flavors in the future, the team currently sells their "Original" 5% ABV as well as their 0% ABC offerings - a ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù ginger beer and a ‚ÄúSpicy‚Äù version that‚Äôs infused with a touch of habanero. (They‚Äôre available in 4-pack cans, 24-pack cases, sixtel kegs and half-barrel kegs.) Anticipating a Bright Future The owners are incredibly excited about continued community collaborations. Food trucks and pop-ups with culinary talents like Rafael Venciol, who‚Äôs opening the city‚Äôs first Filipino restaurant, have brought about an exciting aspect to the venue that even the owners didn't anticipate. The duo says they‚Äôre aware of the neighborhood's lower socioeconomic roots, and they‚Äôre encouraged by the planned pedestrian bridge that will help connect Larimer, East Liberty and Shadyside. Both can‚Äôt wait to see what lies ahead. ‚ÄúIt's an exciting time for ginger beer and for the city,‚Äù says Lewis. We, too, can‚Äôt wait to see what Jackworth does next. Enjoying Beverages All Around the ‚ÄòBurgh Beyond this neighborhood and Jackworth‚Äôs alluring offerings, there are countless spots around town to try innovative beverages. Visit happening spots from the Strip‚Äôs Maggie‚Äôs Farm Rum and Soluna‚Äôs back-room mezcal bar, to tiki-centric Hidden Harbor, Lawrenceville‚Äôs Bar Botanico and Bloomfield‚Äôs Tina‚Äôs, where they‚Äôre passionate about a 50-plus classic cocktail menu and their affordable pricing structure. Mocktails are certainly having a moment, too, and we suspect they‚Äôre here to stay. Try N/A options at Dear James inside Lawrence Hall or neighboring The Vandal, where the Stappi Spritz is said to taste and look like a Negroni, and the Soiree melds together cucumber, lavender, verjus blanc and lemon soda. At Kaya, zero-proof cocktails come along with clever names like the Pina No-Lada and the No-Jito.No matter what you‚Äôre sipping, it feels an exhilarating moment to follow along.
