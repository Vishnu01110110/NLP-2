Over the past 10 years, more than 400 startups linked to CMU have raised more than $7 billion in follow-on funding. Those investment numbers are especially high because of the sheer size of Pittsburgh’s growing autonomous vehicles cluster – including Uber, Aurora, Waymo and Motional – all of which are here because of their strong ties to CMU. With cutting-edge brain science, path-breaking performances, innovative startups, driverless cars, big data, big ambitions, Nobel and Turing prizes, hands-on learning, and a whole lot of robots, CMU doesn't imagine the future, we create it. About CMU Andrew Carnegie famously said, "My heart is in the work." At CMU, we think about work a little differently... 14,500+ Students 1,300+ Faculty 109,900+ Alumni In Pittsburgh Many seek Pittsburgh for being a hot spot for entrepreneurship and a model for future cities.

This was the beginning of emoticons in email, and the precursor to emojis. ;-)   :-(   :-o Fifteen minutes & counting Carnegie Mellon alumnus Andy Warhol was an iconic figure in the pop art movement that explored the relationship of art to modern celebrity culture and advertising. His work included hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film and music. A pioneer in computer-generated art, he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Changing the way the cookie crumbles It's never too early for women to learn the art of negotiation, and that's why a Carnegie Mellon professor has partnered with the Girl Scouts. The first Girl Scout badge for negotiation, named "Win-Win: How to Get What You Want," started with Carnegie Mellon professor Linda Babcock. To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful — and it goes beyond selling cookies. Babcock has also co-authored two books on the subject: Women Don't Ask and Ask for it: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want. Cruise controlled In 1979, Carnegie Mellon established the nation's first Robotics Institute. Since then, professor and alumnus William "Red" Whittaker has been a robotics pioneer, founding the discipline of Field Robotics, developing unmanned vehicles to clean up the Three Mile Island nuclear accident site, and leading the Tartan Racing Team to victory in the $2 million Urban Challenge robotic autonomous vehicles race. Technologies like these can help make driving safer by preventing accidents.

Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is committed to fostering an environment where all members of our community have a sense of belonging. This commitment drives our pursuit of creating a space where every voice can be heard. We seek to cultivate diverse populations and perspectives and promote equity and inclusion. Our devotion to these ideals springs from a core belief in the power of education to be a transformative and enriching force for every person, irrespective of their background, identity or life circumstances. Inclusion and belonging are intricately interwoven into the very essence of our university, helping to shape our values, policies and practices. Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging are not only central to our ethos but also indispensable to our pursuit of academic excellence and innovation. Let's continue on this journey together. Contact Office of the Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer412-268-4744vp-dei@andrew.cmu.edu Visit Website Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion412-268-2150csdi@andrew.cmu.edu Visit website Messages from Leadership "Since our founding, Carnegie Mellon University has been committed to promoting academic excellence and economic mobility through education. Succeeding on this front requires us to both expand access and remove barriers to opportunity in pursuit of a more inclusive and diverse learning environment. These efforts are ongoing and remain critical to our university's mission to advance learning, research, and creativity and make a positive impact on society more broadly." Dr. Farnam JahanianPresidentHenry L. Hillman President's Chair “As CMU continues to work together to create a more diverse, inclusive, equitable and multiculturally aware community, we are guided by our vision of a framework for inclusive excellence. Together, we can use this framework to reflect our shared goals, promote transparency and accountability, and align our strategies and everyday action to our core DEIB values.” Dr. Wanda Heading-GrantVice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Diversity A broad concept that includes differences in society’s opportunities, the shaping of social institutions by different social factors, the formation of group and individual identity, and the processes of social change. This includes race, class, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, disability, language, and region of residence, among others. Equity Equity occurs when all people or groups in a community are given access to the correct number and types of resources that enable them to achieve equal results. Equity differs from equality, which focuses on the equal distribution of resources, rather than on equal results. Inclusion The notion that an organization or system is welcoming to new populations and/or identities. Each new presence is not merely tolerated, but expected to contribute meaningfully to the system in a positive, mutually beneficial way. Inclusive processes and practices strive to bring groups together to make decisions in collaborative, mutual, and equitable ways. Belonging Mutual power, access, and opportunity among all groups and individuals within a shared community (such as a society, organization, club, etc). Operationalizing belonging requires that all groups and individuals can contribute to and impact the community to which they seek to belong. Their contributions and impact may entail a profound transformation of the community itself, beyond the mere inclusion of individuals within them. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging

==================================================

Rankings College and university rankings continue to proliferate, but their value to individuals and to the institutions remains a subject of some debate. Some rankings are designed purely for entertainment, little more than internet photo galleries. Others make a more serious effort at collecting information. Even where rankings do collect objective statistics such as test scores or costs, the choice of which factors to include in a ranking, and how those factors are weighted, remains subjective. The effects of those methodologies, and the reasons for those choices, are not always readily apparent. For prospective students, families, potential staff and faculty who are deciding whether to invest time and resources in an institution, it is essential that you decide what factors are important to your success and the outcomes you seek. Those will include some objective information, which you can find on the pages of the Carnegie Mellon University website, or on sites for which CMU provides information, such as IPEDS College Navigator or collegedata.com. Your decision should also take into account your own assessment about programs, culture and opportunities for growth.

					on Twitter to submit a brag.  Explore CMU's big ideas — a gallery of innovations and sparks of inspiration that have grown to shape the world. We don't just imagine the future, we create it. First Computer That Could Think In December 1955, professor Herbert Simon and business Ph.D. student Allen Newell made a breakthrough that would place them among the founders of artificial intelligence. Their invention of a programming language for computers to model complex human problem-solving processes resulted in a "thinking machine," as they described it. School of Computer Science » Changing the Way the Cookie Crumbles It’s never too early for women to learn the art of negotiation, and that’s why a Carnegie Mellon professor has partnered with the Girl Scouts. The first Girl Scout badge for negotiation, named "Win-Win: How to Get What You Want" started with Carnegie Mellon professor Linda Babcock. To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful—and it goes beyond selling cookies. Babcock has also co-authored two books on the subject: Women Don’t Ask and Ask for It: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want. Air Andy: Wireless is Born Started in 1994 to support Carnegie Mellon's wireless research, the "Wireless Andrew" network laid the foundation for today's Wi-Fi that allows computers and mobile devices to access the Internet anytime, anywhere — wirelessly. Alumnus and engineering professor Alex Hills founded the university's wireless initiative that today covers the 145-acre Pittsburgh campus. Stages and Screens Countless Carnegie Mellon alumni have shaped the world of entertainment, including College of Fine Arts graduates Ted Danson of "CSI" and "Cheers"; Steven Bochco of "Hill Street Blues"; John Wells of "ER"; Paula Kauffman Wagner of "Mission Impossible"; Zachary Quinto of "Heros" and "Star Trek"; Tamara Tunie of "Law & Order: SVU"; and Cherry Jones of "Doubt" and numerous stage productions. The list doesn't end with arts alumni. Even an engineering alumnus — Emmy award-winner Bud Yorkin — made a mark on the entertainment world with "All in the Family". Carnegie Mellon's prominence in the arts dates back to 1914, when it awarded the U.S.'s first undergraduate degree in drama. Fifteen Minutes and Counting Carnegie Mellon alumnus Andy Warhol, was an iconic figure in the pop art movement that explored the relationship of art to modern celebrity culture and advertising. His work included hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film and music. A pioneer in computer-generated art, he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. We Have Style Alumna Gela Nash-Taylor (right) started as an actress, but quickly found her passion in fashion. With just $200 and endless ideas, Nash-Taylor and her partner, Pam Skaist-Levy (left), launched the world-renowned Juicy Couture fashion line. Bulletproof Polymer scientist and alumna Stephanie Kwolek made a discovery in 1965 that led to the Kevlar® fiber, which is used today in protective clothing for firefighters and bulletproof vests for soldiers and police officers. This material has saved the lives of law enforcement officers for decades and is also used in 200 other products from bridge cables to tires. Hello, World In 1994, alumnus James Gosling became the "Father of Java" when he invented the Java computer programming language. Java has now become one of the most popular programming languages in use today. A Start on Stage Written for Carnegie Mellon’s student theater, "Scotch 'n' Soda," Pippin gave composer/lyricist and alumnus Stephen Schwartz his first Tony nomination in 1973, and won a Tony for Best Musical Revival in 2013. Oscars, Grammys and Drama Desk Awards have followed for Godspell, Pocahontas, The Prince of Egypt and Wicked. Teaching the Science of Business In the 1960’s, Carnegie Mellon’s business school, today known as the Tepper School of Business, pioneered a new model for business education: Management Science. This approach successfully applied scientific methods in the process of solving complex problems, unleashing the power and beneficial use of data and analytics for marketplace and policy applications. Today, some form of Carnegie Mellon’s original academic model is taught at every leading business school worldwide. First Smile in an Email The Smiley :-) was created by Carnegie Mellon research professor Scott Fahlman on September 19, 1982. This was the beginning of emoticons in email. ;-) :-( :-o Four Giants Under One Roof When the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center (RMCIC), opened its doors on Carnegie Mellon's campus in 2005, it was the only building in the world where Google, Intel, Apple and a Microsoft-sponsored research lab were under one roof. Today, the RMCIC continues to facilitate meaningful partnerships between corporate research activities and Carnegie Mellon faculty and students on the Pittsburgh campus. Preventing Computer Crime One Word at a Time Alumnus and professor Luis von Ahn and his colleagues are responsible for developing CAPTCHAs, those wavy, distorted words online shoppers often need to decipher before completing a transaction. CAPTCHA stands for "completely automated public Turing tests to tell computers and humans apart." About 200 million CAPTCHAs are used each day, and they prevent many forms of computer crime. Von Ahn’s latest version, reCAPTCHAs, goes a step further, harnessing this puzzle-solving human effort to digitize smudged words from old books and newspapers. Cruise Controlled In 1979, CMU established the nation's first Robotics Institute. Since then, professor and alumnus William "Red" Whittaker has been a robotics pioneer, founding the discipline of Field Robotics, developing unmanned vehicles to clean up the Three Mile Island nuclear accident site, and leading the Tartan Racing Team to victory in the $2 million Urban Challenge robotic autonomous vehicles race. Technologies like these can help make driving safer by preventing accidents. Now Whittaker and his team have plans to land and operate a robot on the moon in pursuit of the $20 million Google Lunar XPRIZE. Scheduling Goes Digital The first computer-generated master schedule in the history of U.S. Major League Baseball was produced in 2005 by Tepper School of Business professor Michael Trick. Trick and his colleagues at the Sports Scheduling Group, a company he co-founded to tame the complex challenge of creating sports schedules that accommodate the teams, fans, facility operators and media, applied its computational models to develop master schedules for some of the most renowned collegiate athletic conferences in the country, including the Big Ten Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference. Greenhouse Carnegie Mellon built the first green dormitory in the U.S. in 2003. Renamed in 2008 as Stever House to honor H. Guyford Stever, the university's fifth president, it has a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) silver designation from the U.S. Green Building Council. CMU and the environment » Alice in Cyberland Alice, a revolutionary way to teach computer programming by creating 3D animations, stories and video games, was developed by the research team of the late Randy Pausch, professor and alumnus, who gained international acclaim for his "Last Lecture" and best-selling book. Now featuring characters from "The SimsTM," one of the best-selling PC video game series of all time, Alice is used in about 15 percent of the United States’ colleges and universities. Experts believe it is likely to reinvigorate computer science education from the middle school level through college. All Wired Up Carnegie Mellon was the first university with a completely wired campus when it developed the Andrew computing network in the mid-1980s. Andrew linked all computers and workstations and established Carnegie Mellon as a leader in the use of technology in education and research. Life-Saving Matches Nearly 102,000 people in the US are on the waiting list for a kidney transplant.* Thousands of kidney patients die each year hoping a matching donor can be found. Computer Science Professor Tuomas Sandholm, developed a computer algorithm that accelerates the matching of living donors with compatible patients, shortening the wait and saving lives.*Data from United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Plastics and Paint Chemistry Professor Krzysztof Matyjaszewski pioneered a process he dubbed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP), which allows chemists to control how polymers are created and led to the development of "everyday" plastics, including those used in paints and sealants. Kris is currently using ATRP to prepare "smart materials" for the medical and environmental fields. (Psychology + Technology) x Carnegie Mellon = Success! Pioneering Carnegie Mellon professor and cognitive psychology graduate Ken Koedinger used his research at the intersection of psychology and computer science to develop tutoring systems that are helping 500,000 students in 2,600 U.S. schools improve their math skills. The Cognitive Tutor program is implemented by a university spin-off company, Carnegie Learning, Inc., and is offered throughout the U.S., from urban high schools to rural middle schools. Monetary Matters Tepper School of Business professor Allan Meltzer, leading expert and consultant for the U.S. Congress, Treasury and Federal Reserve, as well as the World Bank and foreign governments, co-founded the influential Shadow Open Market Committee in the early 1970s to better inform the media, general public and policymakers about financial policy decisions. His latest work, A History of the Federal Reserve, 1913–1986, sheds new light on U.S. monetary policy. We Got Game Carnegie Mellon students and faculty created software that uses video game technology to train first responders such as firefighters, police officers and emergency medical personnel to handle biological attacks and chemical spills. The Fire Department of New York, which provided input for the development of the software, now uses it to train its cadets. This innovation is among many created at the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC). A joint program of the College of Fine Arts and the School of Computer Science, the ETC also gave the U.S. Its first Master of Technology degree. GigaPan The GigaPan Camera System is a robotic device that enables any digital camera to shoot breathtaking multibillion-pixel panoramic images. GigaPan was developed by professor Illah Nourbakhsh and Randy Sargent, a project scientist at Carnegie Mellon's Silicon Valley campus, in collaboration with scientists at NASA's Ames Research Center, and with support from Google. The potential applications are endless. Photo © 2009 David BergmanView David's GigaPan Photo » Worldwide Branding The creativity percolating within Terry Heckler is on display every day for millions of people around the world. Heckler, founder of Heckler Associates, has named hundreds of brands and created some of the most recognizable logos in the world, including Starbucks Coffee, Panera Bread, JanSport, and New Balance, just to name a few. Walking on Water Mechanical engineers at Carnegie Mellon have created robots that can walk on water. The "bugs," two to six inches long and weighing a few grams, can shoot over water. Called STRIDE, for surface tension-based robotic insect dynamic explorer, the robots use the water's surface tension to amble on their spindly legs exactly like water striders. These robots can detect harmful toxins in water for both the environmental sector and the military. Building Business Pioneering faculty at what is now the Tepper School of Business wrote one of the most influential business books of all time: A Behavioral Theory of the Firm. Professor Richard Cyert and professor James March developed theoretical building blocks that have become the foundation for current research in organizational studies in management, economics, political science and sociology. Built by Fans, for Fans Electrical and computer engineering professor Priya Narasimhan’s love of Pittsburgh sports led her to found YinzCam, Inc., a Carnegie Mellon spinoff company focused on mobile live streaming and scalable video technologies. YinzCam is now the ultimate mobile experiential app for more than 40 professional sports teams, venues and thousands of fans. #Hashtag Carnegie Mellon alumnus Chris Messina sparked the idea to use a # symbol for grouping subjects on Twitter. The now ubiquitous "hashtag" has gone far beyond Twitter to become a part of common vernacular, as well as an essential social media and commerce tool for both individuals and global brands.

Changing the way the cookie crumbles It's never too early for women to learn the art of negotiation, and that's why a Carnegie Mellon professor has partnered with the Girl Scouts. The first Girl Scout badge for negotiation, named "Win-Win: How to Get What You Want," started with Carnegie Mellon professor Linda Babcock. To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful — and it goes beyond selling cookies. Babcock has also co-authored two books on the subject: Women Don't Ask and Ask for it: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want.

==================================================

Andrew Carnegie A self-educated "working boy" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa. Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist. He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century. Carnegie Technical Schools At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that "to die rich is to die disgraced." He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities. "My heart is in the work," he stated, which would become part of the school's official motto. The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College. Carnegie Tech – Early Years Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or "Carnegie Tech." During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. Some key developments were: Carnegie Tech - Post-war Years With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study. University culture also changed in 1973 when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms. The times were changing, and Tech positioned itself at the forefront, opening three new schools:   Carnegie Mellon University In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University. The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons. It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery. A Global Impact In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists. In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh. Today its global presence includes campuses in Qatar and Silicon Valley, Calif., more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships such as Los Angeles; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Australia; China; Portugal and Rwanda. The Future CMU is positioned like never before to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In the coming years, the university will see the largest expansion to the Pittsburgh campus since 1900. At the intersection of technology and humanity, CMU research, innovation and creativity will continue to guide our future as a world-class university. As outlined in the Strategic Plan 2025, the university will focus on advancing the individual student experience, the broader Carnegie Mellon community experience, and the social impact of Carnegie Mellon throughout the world.

Traditions Dating back more than a century, some Carnegie Mellon University traditions have a Scottish flavor (The Kiltie Band) as a nod to founder Andrew Carnegie. Other experiences blossomed from the minds of students (The Fence). Kiltie Band This kilt-clad student marching band — the self-named "Band Without Pants" — has entertained home football games with songs, chants, cheers and a quirky sense of humor since 1922. The Fence The Fence is painted between midnight and sunrise by students who then stand guard as long as they want their message to stay. Fun Fact: The original Fence was once the "most painted object in the world" until it collapsed and was replaced by a steel-concrete fence. Spring Carnival The entire community comes together for this four-day festival, Carnegie Mellon's oldest tradition. Buggy Sweepstakes A Spring Carnival highlight, students race "buggies," often reaching up to 35 mph. Student groups design and build the aerodynamic cylinders — "pushmobiles," as they were called when the tradition started in 1920. Bagpipers It doesn't get more Scottish than bagpipes. Carnegie Mellon's Pipes and Drums can be found practicing around campus and performing at formal university events. Autographs Behind the stage of Kresge Theatre senior "dramats" (drama students) sign the walls and ceiling before graduating. Among these young hopefuls: Ted Danson, Blair Underwood and Holly Hunter.

Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is committed to fostering an environment where all members of our community have a sense of belonging. This commitment drives our pursuit of creating a space where every voice can be heard. We seek to cultivate diverse populations and perspectives and promote equity and inclusion. Our devotion to these ideals springs from a core belief in the power of education to be a transformative and enriching force for every person, irrespective of their background, identity or life circumstances. Inclusion and belonging are intricately interwoven into the very essence of our university, helping to shape our values, policies and practices. Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging are not only central to our ethos but also indispensable to our pursuit of academic excellence and innovation. Let's continue on this journey together.

Succeeding on this front requires us to both expand access and remove barriers to opportunity in pursuit of a more inclusive and diverse learning environment. These efforts are ongoing and remain critical to our university's mission to advance learning, research, and creativity and make a positive impact on society more broadly." Dr. Farnam JahanianPresidentHenry L. Hillman President's Chair “As CMU continues to work together to create a more diverse, inclusive, equitable and multiculturally aware community, we are guided by our vision of a framework for inclusive excellence. Together, we can use this framework to reflect our shared goals, promote transparency and accountability, and align our strategies and everyday action to our core DEIB values.” Dr. Wanda Heading-GrantVice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Diversity A broad concept that includes differences in society’s opportunities, the shaping of social institutions by different social factors, the formation of group and individual identity, and the processes of social change. This includes race, class, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, disability, language, and region of residence, among others. Equity Equity occurs when all people or groups in a community are given access to the correct number and types of resources that enable them to achieve equal results. Equity differs from equality, which focuses on the equal distribution of resources, rather than on equal results. Inclusion The notion that an organization or system is welcoming to new populations and/or identities. Each new presence is not merely tolerated, but expected to contribute meaningfully to the system in a positive, mutually beneficial way. Inclusive processes and practices strive to bring groups together to make decisions in collaborative, mutual, and equitable ways. Belonging Mutual power, access, and opportunity among all groups and individuals within a shared community (such as a society, organization, club, etc). Operationalizing belonging requires that all groups and individuals can contribute to and impact the community to which they seek to belong. Their contributions and impact may entail a profound transformation of the community itself, beyond the mere inclusion of individuals within them. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging
