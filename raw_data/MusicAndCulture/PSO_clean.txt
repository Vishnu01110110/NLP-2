Frequently Asked Questions
Frequently Asked Questions for Pre-Performance:
-How can I order tickets?
Tickets for most events are on sale 24 hours/day from our
online calendar. The Heinz Hall Box Office hours are Monday - Friday, 9 am - 6 PM, Saturday 12 pm - 4 pm. Tickets may be purchased by calling 412.392.4900 Monday - Friday, 9 am - 6 pm, Saturday 12 pm - 4 pm. Services charges apply to phone and Internet orders.


-When can I arrive for concerts?
Our doors open one hour and 15 minutes prior to classical concerts and one hour prior for all other performances. For a relaxing and enjoyable experience, we encourage you to arrive early, particularly if you need to stop at the box office.


-How do I print my tickets at home?
If you selected to print your tickets at home in the purchase path, you can follow the
instructions here to print them.


-What are your security policies?
Entrance Security Policy
All audience members are required to enter through state-of-the-art scanning equipment, designed both to enhance security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There will be no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment.
Bag and Personal Belongings Policy
Heinz Hall reserves the right to search any bags entering the facility. Oversized bags must fit comfortably under a seat to ensure the safety of patrons entering or exiting seats and aisles. Bags failing to meet these requirements must be checked at which time a search will be conducted by security or returned to your vehicle. You are encouraged to leave personal computers and iPads at home, as they are required to be turned off during performances.
Costume Policy
Heinz Hall does not permit masks of any kind or facsimiles of weapons that would make other guests feel uncomfortable or detract from the concert experience. Guests are welcome to attend certain programs (such as, The Music of Harry Potter or The Music of Star Wars) in costume.


-What exactly is the Heinz Hall “free-flow” screening system?
In use at hundreds of sites worldwide including Lincoln Center, Oakland (CA) Airport and LL Bean, the Heinz Hall screening system uses “smart” technology to enhance visitor security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There is no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances.


-What if I don't want to go through the scanner?
An alternative entry door will be available that will have wanding and bag check.


-Is the scanner safe for medical devices and pregnant women?
The system is safe to go through with medical devices and for pregnant women. However, on request, you may use the alternative entry door that will have wanding and bag check.


-Is screening the same at every concert or event?
As is the case now, artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances.


-What makes the system "smart" and what will you do with the video images?
The screening equipment uses technology to screen for threats. The images captured by the system for alarm purposes are only captured briefly; they are not retained by Heinz Hall.


-What should I wear to concerts?
There is no official dress code for events in Heinz Hall. Many patrons wear business attire, and many prefer to be more casual. Wear whatever makes you feel more comfortable.


-May I bring my children?
Introducing small children to music is important to the PSO and we welcome young children to our youth concerts and Fiddlesticks Family Concerts. Children, approximately age six and over, are welcome at all performances with a purchased ticket (please see Safely Together for current mask and vaccination requirements). The Latecomer's Gallery and lobby video monitors are always options for restless children.


-Will there be dinner service in the Mozart Room?
We do not anticipate the Mozart Room reopening in the near future. Please patronize our
dining partners around Heinz Hall.


-Do you have a pre-concert "rush" program?
Yes. Beginning two hours prior to most BNY Mellon Grand Classics and PNC Pops performances, students and seniors (age 62+) may purchase discounted rush tickets. Rush tickets are subject to availability and are restricted to certain seating sections. Students and seniors must present valid identification and may purchase one discounted ticket per person. Please note that rush pricing is subject to change. In order to guarantee seating availability, we suggest purchasing tickets prior to the day of the concert you wish to attend. Please note that the PSO offers discounted student and senior subscriptions, which offer the best savings as well as exclusive benefits. For more information on students and senior subscriptions, please
click here.


-Can I organize a group for a concert?
Absolutely. With a group ticket purchase you receive discounted tickets, priority seats, personalized service and free reception space. For more information, call 412.392.4819 or visit our website at pittsburghsymphony.org/groups


-Are there any other services that I should be aware of?
The Concierge Service, in the Entrance Lobby, is available to assist with information about Heinz Hall, the Cultural District and area attractions and to help with dining, hotel, entertainment and transportation concerns as well as lost and found.


-Where can I find Heinz Hall policies?
Heinz Hall policies can be found on our website.


-Can I check my coat?
Coin-operated lockers are located on the Lower and Gallery levels.


-How will I find parking?
Pittsburgh's Cultural District can be very busy but guaranteed prepaid parking is available to all ticket holders in the Sixth & Penn garage across from Heinz Hall. You may purchase prepaid parking when you order your tickets. If you have a smartphone, the ParkPGH app helps you to locate available garage parking near the Cultural District on the go.


Frequently Asked Questions for Performance:
-When should I applaud?
Applause is usually appropriate at the end of a piece (when the conductor lowers his hands). In a multi-movement work, it is customary to wait until the end of the last movement to applaud, so as not to break the concentration of the performers.


-What if I have to cough?
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra provides complimentary cough drops at the concierge desk located in the entrance lobby.


-May I take pictures?
Unless otherwise announced in the program and at the concert, the use of still, video and digital cameras or audio recording equipment is strictly prohibited at all times in the concert hall. You are more than welcome to take photos and video in the lobbies and garden area of Heinz Hall.


-What if I arrive late?
There is a Latecomer's Gallery, located behind the Main Floor, which affords patrons who arrive after the beginning of a concert the opportunity to enjoy the performance until they can be seated. Latecomers will be seated at suitable intervals during the program, at the discretion of the conductor. The Latecomer's Gallery is also available for parents with younger children.


-What accessible services are available at Heinz Hall?
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Heinz Hall are committed to providing an environment that is inclusive and welcoming to all patrons. For information about our accessible services, please contact the box office at 412.392.4900 or visit our Accessibility page.
