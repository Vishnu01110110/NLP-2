Only stomachs of steel will prevail in this new contest category! Whoever eats the most pickles by weight in five minutes (‘chipmunking’ is allowed) will win their round and earn a spot in the final, where the Earl of Eating, first of their name, will be crowned. 


-Bobbing for Pickles – New:
No hands are allowed in this pickled take on the peculiar party pastime. Whoever can retrieve the most pickles by weight in 90 seconds using only their mouth will win the round and face-off in the finals to become Picklesburgh’s first Baron of Bobbing!
