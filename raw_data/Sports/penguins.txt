==================================================

Malkin's Milestone Run With Evgeni Malkin at 498 career goals entering the season, becoming the 48th player in NHL history to reach 500 has loomed large on the horizon. He joked about it in training camp, saying his expectations for himself are, “score two goals!” But with four helpers in his first three games, Malkin has quietly hit two other impressive milestones. On Thursday in Detroit, he became the 34th player in NHL history to record 800 assists, joining Sidney Crosby (1,006) and Patrick Kane (813) as the only active players with 800 assists. He is the first Russian-born player in NHL history to reach this milestone. “For me, it's all about partners, you know?” Malkin said that night. “I play with lots of guys, probably most guys retired [smiles], but I'm still playing. I always have fun with anybody. We always have a great team here. It’s good signing amazing players. I play with Sid on power play, probably I give him the most assists in my life. But again, it's a great milestone for me… and like, I need more, probably.” Malkin got a couple more on Saturday in Toronto, becoming the 37th player in NHL history to reach 1,300 points (498G-802A). He tied Hall-of-Famer Jarome Iginla for the 36th-most points in league history. Only Ovechkin (1,551) has more points than Malkin among Russian-born players. Malkin was reticent to acknowledge that particular achievement following a tough 4-2 loss to the Maple Leafs. But Head Coach Mike Sullivan made sure Malkin received the proper due. “I think it speaks for itself. He's one of the greatest players of all time. He's clearly one of the best players of this generation,” Sullivan said. “We’re fortunate that we have two of them on our team. It's quite a privilege to watch these two guys perform… I know the Pittsburgh fan base feels the same way.” Of course, so do his teammates. A number of them took to social media to show some respect for Malkin’s accomplishments, with players like Kris Letang, Erik Karlsson, Rickard Rakell and Michael Bunting reposting milestone graphics honoring ‘Geno’ on their Instagram stories. The captain isn’t on social media, but talked about what his fellow franchise center has been able to do in the locker room after Sunday’s practice “He got 800 assists the other night, 1,300 points… the next one is a big one too,” Crosby said. “I think he’s had a great start to the season, and obviously been doing it pretty well for a long time. So, those numbers are pretty impressive.” Malkin, now the oldest player on Pittsburgh’s roster at 38 years old, has been vocal about how hungry he is to help this team win hockey games. “I don't want to be here the next two years just to like, play my game, score 500 goals, and do nothing after. I want to be here to win,” Malkin said. “My goal this summer and this season is to help the team to make playoffs, for sure. I don’t want to be on the outside of the playoffs. I think Sid thinks the same way, Tanger as well.” That’s been evident in his play on the ice, as Malkin looks fast, and he looks strong. “He's such a passionate guy. He's playing extremely hard,” Sullivan said. “I think when you look at what he's accomplished, along with the other guys that he's played with that we talk about all the time, his legacy is remarkable. To continue to play at an elite level like he has shown is just a huge credit to him and how hard he works. I think it stems from his love for hockey and his passion for the game.” News Feed Game Preview: 10.14.24 at Montreal Canadiens Rust Debuts in Loss to Toronto; Malkin Gets 1,300th Point Game Preview: 10.12.24 at Toronto Maple Leafs Getting to Know: Anthony Beauvillier Dream Debut for Joel Blomqvist Blomqvist makes 29 saves in debut, Penguins defeat Red Wings It Takes a Village Game Preview: 10.10.24 at Detroit Red Wings Sully Says: 2024.25 Season Opener "Earned Every Aspect": McGroarty to Make NHL Debut Game Preview: 10.09.24 vs. New York Rangers A New Chapter Begins at PPG Paints Arena Penguins Hope New Ideas and Mindset Help Power Play Penguins Forward Evgeni Malkin to Continue “I’m Score for Kids” Initiative Benefiting Ronald McDonald House Charities of Pittsburgh and Morgantown for Third-Consecutive Season in 2024-25 Analyzing Pittsburgh's Opening-Night Roster Penguins Look to Rewrite the Story: Dubas Lays Out Vision Penguins Finalize Roster for the 2024-25 Season Jesse Puljujarvi "One of the Best Surprises" of Camp Erik Karlsson Should Be Ready to Go for Season Opener Sully Says: Preseason Finale Eat, Shop, Tour: Penguins Elevate the Fan Experience Sully Says: Penguins 3, Blue Jackets 1 (Preseason Game 6) Game Preview: 10.04.24 vs. Columbus Penguins vs. Blue Jackets Preseason Lineup – 10.04.24 Game Preview: 10.03.24 at Columbus Harrison Brunicke Leaving "Terrific" Impression Penguins vs. Blue Jackets Preseason Lineup – 10.03.24 Penguins' Goalie Depth Tested Early with Nedeljkovic Injury Sully Says: Penguins vs. Red Wings (Preseason Game 4) Nedeljkovic Leaves Game; Blomqvist Stars in Relief Game Preview: 10.01.24 vs. Detroit Penguins vs. Red Wings Preseason Lineup – 10.01.24 Game Preview: 09.30.24 at Detroit Crosby, Malkin Put on a Show for Hockeyville Game Preview: 09.29.24 at Ottawa (Hockeyville) Statement from the Pittsburgh Penguins Game Preview: 09.28.24 at Detroit Penguins Preseason Lineups versus Red Wings (09.28.24) and Senators (Kraft Hockeyville - 09.29.24) Getting to Know: Matt Grzelcyk Three's Company Penguins Reduce Training Camp Roster to 52 Players "Committed" Rakell Ready to Return to Form Sully Says: Penguins vs. Sabres (Preseason Game 2) Game Preview: 09.24.24 vs. Buffalo Penguins vs. Sabres Preseason Lineup – 09.24.24 Burgh Proud PensTV Staff Wins Emmy Awards in Three Categories at 2024 Mid-Atlantic Regional Emmy Awards Preseason Opener a Good Test for Penguins Penguins Trim Training Camp Roster to 64 Players Game Preview: 09.21.24 at Buffalo

==================================================

Getting to Know: Anthony Beauvillier Signed as a free agent to a one-year contract on July 1, forward Anthony Beauvillier joined the Penguins ready to “bet on himself,” according to President of Hockey Operations and GM Kyle Dubas. Coming off a challenging 2023-24 season, Beauvillier had a strong summer of training, and felt ready to turn the page with his new team. “I feel like I'm in the right place mentally, and I have a lot of trust in my game right now,” the 27-year-old forward said at the end of training camp. The Penguins had Beauvillier skating with Sidney Crosby from Day 1, as his ability to hunt down pucks, create space down low, and find the open areas on the ice are qualities that complement the captain’s game. For Beauvillier’s part, he’s tried to keep the game simple when playing with one of his childhood idols. “Obviously a role model for me growing up and always loved his game, the way he plays, how hard he does it,” Beauvillier said. “He’s just so smart on the ice and it’s been a pleasure to play with him. Just trying to give him the puck and try to get open.” They executed that plan well on Thursday in Detroit, with Beauvillier scoring his first two goals as a Penguin, and Crosby earning assists on both tallies. “When you play with a player like Sid, and you play in the top six of any team, there's pressure to play there,” Head Coach Mike Sullivan said. “Obviously, when you're playing with a guy like Sidney Crosby, I think there's another level to that. So, I think Sid and Beau have established some chemistry. He brings that speed element that I think Sid likes on his line, so that he can hunt pucks and force turnovers. To get rewarded tonight with a couple of goals will be a huge boost of confidence for him.” With no practice on Friday ahead of their game against the Maple Leafs, hopefully Beauvillier rewarded himself with a good brunch, one of his favorite off-day activities. Get to know more about Marc-Andre Fleury’s fellow Sorel-Tracey native in this recent Q&A. Getting to Know Penguins forward, Anthony Beauvillier. First of all, what’s the story behind the nickname ‘Tito’? I’ve always been called Tito growing up. It’s kind of slang for Anthony. I’m not sure the meaning of it or anything, I think it’s just, the ‘ti’ is like saying ‘little.’ So, I would guess it was like Lil Tony, and it ended up being Tito. Tell us about your hometown. I’m from Sorel. It’s a town 45 minutes away from Montreal in Canada. It’s a really small community and it’s deep in Quebec, so not a lot of people know about that. Definitely more family-oriented kind of town. Do you go back during the summer? My parents are still there; I’m a few minutes away from there, just outside of Montreal. Like, 20-25 minutes away. So, just over the bridge, and that’s very convenient when you have people in town. It’s a cool little area; there’s usually really good golf there, and the weather is usually pretty good in the summer. It’s a fun place to be. Do you have any siblings? I have an older brother, Francis. He was drafted by Florida, and actually, his draft was here in Pittsburgh in 2012. We got stuck in an elevator here at PPG. That’s a fun story (laughs). How long were you stuck for?! I don’t know, we were stuck for like ten minutes, maybe. What do else you remember from that experience of being in Pittsburgh?
It was a great experience. I remember walking around Pittsburgh, going on the bridges, and looking at the ballpark. The arena at the time was brand-new, and I just remember walking around being so impressed by the draft. It was my first experience being at the draft and seeing him get drafted was a pretty cool experience. What players or teams did you like growing up? The Canadiens, and actually the Penguins, because of Flower and their Cup teams. Did people take notice in Sorel that Fleury was going to become the player that he is today? Yeah, of course. We also had François Beauchemin, who’s from there as well, and [Nicholas] Aube-Kubel, who’s now in Buffalo. So, we’re kind of all connected to make the golf tournament. Me, Flower, and Beauchemin started it. Who would be on your dream golf team? Probably just my father, my brother, and my grandfather. That would be cool to have my grandfather there. Do you do a golf tournament in your grandfather’s honor? Both of my grandparents on my mother’s side passed away from Alzheimer’s. So, that’s why I’ve done some charity work with Alzheimer’s. What would your job be if you weren’t a hockey player? Probably like, a gym teacher or something. Or something in sports. What other sports do you enjoy playing/watching? I enjoy watching tennis, also enjoy playing it. I enjoy playing pickleball and golf. What’s always on your grocery list? I feel like crackers, always. Get some cheese on it, it’s so good, there’s nothing better. If it’s a charcuterie board then you can go crazy a little bit, but usually I just go with cheddar. Any go-to TV shows or movies? I like to throw on in the background Friends or How I Met Your Mother. Favorite podcasts or books? I’d say my favorite book is probably “The Open” from Andre Agassi. It’s one of the few that I’ve read, and it’s my favorite. What do you like to do when you’re not at the rink? I just like to relax, go for walks, go for brunch on days off. What are your favorite brunch items? I’m boring. I just like to keep it simple. Eggs, bacon, and a little something extra, a little sugar, like pancakes or French toast.

==================================================

Rust Debuts in Loss to Toronto; Malkin Gets 1,300th Point Bryan Rust made his season debut in Pittsburgh’s third game of the season on Saturday in Toronto, a 4-2 loss to the Maple Leafs. The winger had been dealing with a lower-body injury since the end of September, with Kyle Dubas saying they wanted to be cautious with Rust’s situation. He referenced what Rust went through last season, missing three games at the end of November before returning for five, and then getting sidelined again for 10. “He's continuing to push, and it makes it worse, and then we have to sit him for a good length of time. So, I would rather be more cautious now with Rusty,” Dubas said last week. “If you don't chain him down, he's going to play.” Rust was deemed ready to go for tonight’s contest against the Maple Leafs, moving into his usual spot on Sidney Crosby’s right wing. His line had a good first shift that set the tone for the opening minutes, where the Penguins did a good job of establishing the relentless puck pursuit game they want to play. Talking with Rust after the game, he said he would have liked to see that translate more on the scoresheet. “My legs felt good,” he said. “I think kind of with and without the puck, just kind of reading plays offensively, I wasn't as sharp as I'd like to be. Kind of missed a few plays there, especially in the first period, where we could have scored some goals. Definitely have to kind of just get up to speed with that and do it as soon as next game.” Rust speaks to the media Rust slotted back in on the top power-play unit for Pittsburgh’s first opportunity of the game about midway through the period. Kris Letang converted with an absolute rocket of a shot into the top far corner. “The forward hit something on the ice, he lost his edge, so that allowed me to walk in,” Letang said. Letang speaks to the media However, the Leafs regrouped and started strong in the second period. William Nylander converted a 2-on-0 rush just 50 seconds in. Matthew Knies capitalized on a fortuitous bounce at the 2:53 mark. While the Penguins settled in a bit after that, they weren’t able to convert either of their two power plays in that period (they went 1-for-4 on the night). “I thought we could have put more pucks on the net than we did (in general),” Head Coach Mike Sullivan said. “We were looking for something better a lot, and sometimes the best play is just putting it on the net and getting traffic there, and we can create opportunities off of it. That's something that we talked about in between periods and on the bench.” After Mitch Marner put Toronto up 3-1 early in the third with a breakaway goal that came off a Penguins breakdown, Rickard Rakell’s first of the year got the Penguins back within one at the 12:29 mark. Evgeni Malkin recorded his 1,300th point, becoming just the third active player with 1,300 career points, joining Crosby (1,598) and Alex Ovechkin (1,550). When asked about the milestone after the game, Malkin said, “when you lost, it’s a little bit different. I’m not looking to my points right now, I want the team to win. “We have a great start tonight, and after we lost momentum a little bit. But we score second goal, have chance 6-on-5, we’re fighting. But we have to play smarter, for sure. We give them Marner goal, breakaway. It’s like, bad mistake. But we’ll fix the problem and I think we’ll be better.” Sullivan was more effusive when asked that same question. “I think it speaks for itself. He's one of the greatest players of all time. He's clearly one of the best players of this generation. We’re fortunate that we have two of them on our team. It's quite a privilege to watch these two guys perform… I know the Pittsburgh fan base feels the same way.” Coach Sullivan speaks to the media After getting a win in his NHL debut on Thursday in Detroit, Joel Blomqvist’s performance impacted the coaching staff’s decision to start the 22-year-old rookie again tonight. Sullivan called his play “solid,” saying Blomqvist made some key saves as the Maple Leafs produced some good looks. “He's pretty calm and composed," Letang added. "He’s a confident kid in net, he’s in his element. We heard so many good things about him in the last few years, and now that he's able to prove it at the NHL level, it's great. Obviously, there's a certain level of maturity that some guys don't have at that age, but he does.” Overall, the Penguins are, as Sullivan called it, "a work in progress" this early in the season. They had their moments, and moving forward, it's a matter of being more consistent throughout all 60 minutes. "I think our start was great. I think we saw the first couple of games, it wasn't as good as we would have liked," Rust said. "I think we gotta continue to have good starts, but we gotta continue to try and carry that momentum out throughout the game." The Penguins finish their three-game season-opening road trip on Monday in Montreal.

==================================================

The Penguins Pledge is a sustainability initiative which serves as the organization's commitment to improve all efforts of social, economic and environmental sustainability. This initiative is a collaborative effort with key partners with the goal of reducing negative impact on the environment and promoting sustainable practices to help preserve natural resources, while also supporting economic and social development. PPG Sets 2030 Sustainability Goals, Including Science-Based Emissions Reduction Targets PPG is committed to using resources efficiently, developing industry-leading sustainably advantaged solutions, and prioritizing decarbonization to protect the world for current and future generations. In 2023, PPG became the first U.S.-based coatings manufacturer to receive validation from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for 2030 scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reduction targets. As part of these targets, the company also introduced further 2030 sustainability goals that focus on driving sales of sustainably advantaged products, reducing its environmental impact, and making a difference in communities. PPG’s paints, coatings and specialty materials protect and beautify the world, many of which offer benefits that support its customers' sustainability ambitions. In 2023, 44% of PPG sales were from sustainably advantaged products and processes that address multiple sustainability benefits, including lower emissions, lower toxicity, energy efficiency, use of renewable raw materials or extending durability. PPG’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report details advancements in its sustainably advantaged innovations, governance of ESG, efforts to reach its 2030 targets and further actions to support customers' sustainability goals. The report is available at ppg.com/sustainability. Score for the Trees The Pittsburgh Penguins and The Davey Tree Expert Company have partnered to plant trees in the greater Pittsburgh area! Every goal scored by a Penguin on home ice adds a number to the tree counter. The two organizations will work with Tree Pittsburgh to plant the total number of trees in or around the city to help restore the urban forest in Pittsburgh. We have planted 273 trees thanks to all of the Penguins home goals scored in the 2022.23 and 2023.24 seasons! "This partnership with the Penguins is exciting because it's making Pittsburgh a greener space for the residents, businesses, and overall community, which is proven to have tremendous health and economic benefits," said Sandra Reid, vice president of corporate communications and strategic planning at Davey Tree. "Cities across the country need to expand and reestablish their urban forests, so it's great to be included in Pittsburgh's mission to do so, and Davey is thrilled to be a part of the process." Building a More Sustainable Future U. S. Steel views sustainability through a simple lens: Sustaining lives and livelihoods by creating a more sustainable future, for our company and the stakeholders who depend on us. To realize this future, we are implementing our Best for All® strategy to transform our company into a sustainable, competitive business, enabling us to remain a pillar of our communities, a source of pride for our employees, and the bedrock of sustainable manufacturing for generations to come. Our Best for All strategy is focused on providing sustainable, visionary steel solutions that serve customers and communities, people and planet. Our contributions to society go beyond the supply of steel, as we engage with the communities in which we live and work to help build a sustainable future. We are doing our part to lower our carbon footprint and promote a circular economy, while continuing to supply the steel that is foundational to manufacturing - just as we have throughout our 120+ year history. Creating a more sustainable future for our company and the stakeholders who depend on us is essential to our long-term success. Steel is also essential to enable a clean energy transition, including wind turbines, solar panel array frames, and the motors and bodies of electric cars. With our focus on innovative customer solutions, empowering people and protecting the environment, the future of steel is sustainable. Household Hazardous Waste Chemical Collection For the past 3 years, PPG has partnered with the Pennsylvania Resource Council (PRC) to host the annual Household Hazardous Waste Chemical collection. This is a drive-through event at PPG Paints Arena which has provided over 1,000 Penguins fans and community members with an opportunity to safely discard any household chemicals such as paints, cleaners, and pesticides throughout the years. Together, PPG, the Penguins, and PRC have been able to help safely dispose of 135,000 pounds of chemical waste, keeping the materials out of homes and garages, while diverting them from our soil, air, and water. Making a Home for Bald Eagles For the past few years, a pair of bald eagles, named "Irvin" and "Claire" (after U.S. Steel's Clairton plant) have been thriving on property at U. S. Steel's Mon Valley Works Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, PA. U. S. Steel shares the beauty of these majestic birds with the community through the installation of live cameras. This is believed to be the first such camera at a steel plant and only the third camera of its kind in Pennsylvania. Click below to catch a live look at "Irvin and Claire" via two live cameras. Penguins, PPG Paints Arena Partner with Green Sports Alliance The Pittsburgh Penguins and PPG Paints Arena are members of the Green Sports Alliance, an environmentally and socially responsible focused nonprofit organization that convenes stakeholders from around the sporting world. The Pittsburgh Penguins will collaborate with other Green Sports Alliance members which include professional sports leagues, teams, venues, universities, and corporate partners to support, expand, and promote their sustainability practices. Visit greensportsalliance.org for more information. Powering Our Past and Pioneering Our Future Have you ever thought about how steel shapes our world? It's not just about towering skyscrapers or massive bridges. Steel has been the backbone of our past and it’s essential to a sustainable future. At U. S. Steel, we are building the future of steel and we're building it one innovation at a time. We recently turned two diesel locomotives at our Mon Valley Works into eco-friendly, battery-powered machines. The locomotives, which travel within the facilities carrying steel, coke, scrap metal, iron ore, and other materials necessary for production, are expected to reduce airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions by .385 tons - the equivalent emissions of 7,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles. As we march towards our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, every step counts. Environmental stewardship isn't just a fancy term for us. It's at the core of everything we do, embedded deep in our S.T.E.E.L. Principles. We're talking about a serious commitment to safeguarding our natural resources. After all, our communities, our ecosystems, and heck, our entire planet's future depends on it. Indra Energy Penguins Pledge Partner and Champion Sustainability Partner Indra Energy is committed to promoting earth-friendly energy and green causes. Our renewable energy plans empower customers to make an impact on their communities. Our customers' electricity usage is paired with renewable energy certificates generated from alternative energy sources in the United States, which may include wind, solar, hydro, or any other zero-emission sources that have been qualified as such. Our residential natural gas usage will be paired with carbon offsets. In 2022 alone, our customers prevented an Estimated 167k+ tons* of carbon from entering the atmosphere just by using our renewable energy plans (*Calculated using the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator). Going beyond energy to make a difference is Indra Energy’s commitment. We are proud partners of the Penguins Pledge, and we are actively supporting four forest planting projects across the United States: replanting in the Rockies and our National Forests, along with replanting on the Appalachian Trail and restoring forests destroyed by fire. Educating the Next Generation of Conservationists - National Aviary and EQT Partnership Thanks to a generous grant from EQT Corporation and the EQT Foundation, National Aviary educators and their flock of Ambassador Birds went on the road during the 2023.24 school year, bringing the Aviary to rural Pennsylvania classrooms. The Aviary presented conservation messaging through 10 in-class and assembly programs to schools outside of Allegheny County. The National Aviary and EQT’s outreach program, Educating the Next Generation of Conservationists, was a tremendous success, teaching concepts in science, technology, engineering, environmental literacy, and sustainability (STEELS), as well as math, geography, wildlife conservation, and more, free of charge to schools. “The live owl is the best! We learned about owls, predator/prey, nocturnal animals, in Kindergarten! They were so excited afterwards, that's all they talked about. It was excellent! I hope this continues every year!”—Kindergarten teacher from Kiski Area School District In 2023.24, because of the EQT Foundation’s support, the National Aviary met with approximately 2,840 rural students and 133 educators—a 28 percent increase in the number of students from 2022-2023! Educating the Next Generation of Conservationists significantly impacts students by providing an engaging, fun science program to thousands of children who are able to apply new information about birds, their native habitats, the environmental pressures they face, and the role that humans play in creating or mitigating these challenges, inspiring conservation action. This is a true partnership between EQT, the Aviary, and teachers and school districts in rural counties. Through the ongoing partnership with EQT and the EQT Foundation, the National Aviary will continue to work with rural schools in the 2024.25 school year.

Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, securitization, insuring, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be disclosed in connection with the negotiation of such transaction, and/or sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. With Your Permission. We may also disclose your information with your permission. Where Information is Processed The information that we collect through the Services will be transferred to and processed in the United States for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We also may subcontract the processing of your data to, or otherwise share your data with, third parties in the United States or countries other than your country of residence. The data protection laws in these countries may be different from, and less stringent than, those in your country of residence. We have appropriate measures in place to protect your Personal Information, such as internal obligations to comply with the EU Standard Contractual Clauses when we receive Personal Information from individuals in the EU. You may contact us at [email protected] to request a copy of the safeguards we have in place. Links to Third Parties The Services contain links to websites and other online services, such as NHL.com, Ticketmaster.com, and others, that are not operated by the Penguin Parties. These third parties may collect information about you through the use of their own cookies and web beacons, may independently collect data or solicit Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party websites and mobile apps, and we recommend that you review the privacy policy posted on each website or mobile application that you use. Security We maintain appropriate and reasonable organizational and technical measures for the protection of the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Personal Information against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion. However, no security program can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. If we learn of a security breach, we will comply with all applicable law to notify you about the breach so that you can take protective steps. Retention of Information We consider several factors to determine how long we keep Personal Information. We consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Once we no longer have a need for your Personal Information, we will securely destroy it in accordance with our standards and applicable laws and regulations. Information Accuracy and Your Rights While we take various steps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of your Personal Information, we rely upon you to provide accurate and complete Personal Information when interacting with us. You may request access and amendment to the Personal Information we have about you. We will take steps to respond to your request. In some limited circumstances, we may not be able to grant you access to your information, for example, if doing so would threaten the security or privacy of another individual. All persons in the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation whose Personal Information is processed by the Penguin Parties have the legal right to request: (i) access, (ii) rectification (iii) erasure, (iv) restriction of processing, (v) object to processing, and/or (vi) data portability of their Personal Information. Any such requests should be submitted to [email protected]. If you are in the EU, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU supervisory authority. However, if you have a complaint regarding the processing of your Personal Information, we kindly request that you first contact us directly as indicated in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy, and we will reply promptly. Your California Privacy Rights California law allows California residents who have provided their personal information to us to request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information (if any) to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared such information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to [email protected]. Children's Privacy The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any information from anyone under the age of 13. We recommend that persons over 13 but under 18 years of age ask their parents for permission before using the Services or sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. From time to time, we may offer children the opportunity to enter promotions or contests via the Services. In those cases, our collection of the children's information will be limited for the purposes of administering the promotions or contests. Our policy is to only collect children's information when we have verifiable parental consent or are otherwise permitted by law. All questions about our policies related to children's personal information and our personal information sharing practices should be directed to [email protected]. Enforcement If you submit an inquiry or complaint to us, we will contact you regarding your concerns. When necessary, we will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the handling of Personal Information that cannot be resolved between you and the Penguin Parties. Changes to Privacy Policy Without prejudice to your rights under applicable law, the Penguin Parties reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology. We will make the revised policy accessible through the Services, so you should review the policy periodically to ensure your familiarity with its terms. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, you will be provided with appropriate notice, and we will seek your consent to the updated policy in accordance with legal requirements. If you do not agree to the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should request deletion of your Personal Information by contacting us at [email protected].

Terms of Service Last Updated: March 8, 2023 THESE TERMS CONTAIN DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES (SECTION 12), EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY (SECTION 13), A DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE (SECTION 18), AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER (SECTION 19), THAT EACH APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS. IN ARBITRATION THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. This is a Legal Agreement. These Terms of Service (the "Terms") are a legal agreement between you, on the one hand, and NHL Interactive CyberEnterprises, LLC and its affiliates (current and future), including NHL Enterprises, L.P., NHL Enterprises Canada, L.P., NHL Enterprises B.V., and the National Hockey League (collectively, the "NHL Entities"), and the member clubs of the National Hockey League ("NHL Member Clubs", and together with the NHL Entities, "NHL", "our", "we" or "us"), on the other hand, governing your access to and use of the digital platforms, websites and online services that display or provide an authorized link to these Terms (collectively, the "Services"). The Services include, without limitation, nhl.com, the NHL mobile application, and NHL.TV, and may include content that may be shown or otherwise displayed in or through the Services, including but not limited to NHL Content (as defined in Section 7), User Content (as defined in Section 3) and Third-Party Materials (as defined in Section 11). Except where prohibited by applicable law (which may include the Province of Quebec), to the extent there is any conflict between the Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver provisions of these Terms on the one hand, and the terms of service or privacy policy of any NHL Member Clubs on the other, the Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver provisions of these Terms shall control. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, your parent or legal guardian must agree to these Terms on your behalf. Certain service providers of ours may operate portions of the Services (i.e., Disney Streaming Services operates NHL.com and the NHL app, and Sportradar and its merchant vendor, Cleeng, operate NHL.TV) (each, a "Service Provider") and you agree that all Service Providers, their respective successors and permitted assigns, and their respective affiliates are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as third-party beneficiaries hereof. Please read these Terms carefully before using the Services. It is your responsibility to check these Terms periodically for changes. Your access to and use of the Services indicates your acceptance and agreement to be bound by the Terms. Do not access or use the Services if you do not accept the Terms. Subject to applicable law (which may include the Province of Quebec), we may impose new conditions or amend or modify the Services or the Terms at any time, for example to reflect changes in laws or regulatory requirements. Any access to or use of the Services by you after we post modifications to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of those modifications and shall apply to your access and use of the Services. Prohibited Content and Activities. You may not access or use, or attempt to access or use, the Services to take any action that could harm us or any other person or entity (each a "person"), interfere with the operation of the Services, or use the Services in a manner that violates any laws. For example, you may not: Violations of system or network security and certain other conduct may result in civil or criminal liability.

The Services may also offer opportunities for you to transmit User Content via third party social media and social networking websites and products ("Third-Party Social Networking Features"). Any use of Third-Party Social Networking Features is subject to these Terms and the then-current terms of use of the applicable third-party website or product ("Third-Party Website Terms"). In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Third-Party Website Terms, these Terms will govern. By providing us User Content, you grant us a royalty-free, fully paid up, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully sub-licensable, transferable, license to publish, reproduce, distribute, transmit, display, disclose, perform, edit, adapt, modify, translate, create derivative works of, sell, offer for sale, export, and otherwise use and exploit your User Content (in its entirety or any portion thereof) for any purpose, in any manner to the extent permitted by law, and in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed. You hereby waive any moral rights you may have in your User Content to the extent permitted by applicable law. You represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary permissions from any entity or person (and, in the case of minors, also from their parents or legal guardians as appropriate) identified in, displayed in or implicated by your submission of User Content (including those shown in photographic or video content).

By providing your User Content to us, you agree to these Terms. We are not obligated to publish or use your User Content. The posting or publishing of any User Content, NHL Content or Third-Party Material is not in any way intended to and does not state, suggest, or imply endorsement by the NHL, including as to the truth, validity, or reliability of the User Content, NHL Content or Third-Party Material. The NHL is not responsible for any User Content or Third-Party Material and has no duty to monitor the User Content or Third-Party Material posted on the Services. Any use of information contained in User Content, NHL Content, or Third-Party Material is at your own risk. The NHL and its designees have the right, but not the obligation, in their sole discretion, to monitor, review, edit, remove, delete, disable, refuse, restrict, or terminate access to your User Content, NHL Content, Third-Party Material, or the Services (in whole or in part) at any time, without prior notice and in our sole discretion, for any or no reason. The obligations that you have to us under these Terms shall survive termination of the Services, any access or use by you of the Services, any User Content on the Services, or these Terms. You shall not post or continue to post any User Content that we have previously advised you not to post. You acknowledge that by submitting your User Content, no confidential, fiduciary, contractually implied, or other relationship is created between you and NHL or between you and any of NHL's third party providers other than as expressly set forth in these Terms.

If you are a parent or legal guardian agreeing to these Terms for the benefit of an individual between the ages of 13 and the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, please be advised that you are fully responsible for his/her/or their User Content and any legal liability that he/she/they may incur. Subscription Services. Billing and Payment. Sales Tax. For certain purchases made via the Services, the NHL Entities (or, where applicable, their Service Providers) are required to collect sales tax (including any applicable VAT tax). In states or regions that impose sales or use tax, a purchase is subject to tax unless specifically exempt. Purchases from the Services are not exempt from sales or use taxes simply because they are made from the Internet or because the NHL Entities are not required to collect sales or use tax by any particular state or region. Whether any sales tax will be collected on a given purchase and the amount of tax charged depends on a number of factors including but not limited to whether the seller is present in a given jurisdiction. The purchaser is responsible for any applicable taxes not collected by the NHL Entities and certain states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return reporting taxable purchases for which tax was not collected by the NHL Entities and to pay such tax. For details, see the website of, or otherwise contact, the applicable taxing authority. If any sales tax will be collected by the NHL Entities in connection with a purchase, that amount will be shown either prior to the completion of any purchase or reflected in the final confirmation of that purchase. For Oklahoma purchasers, applicable use tax on purchases made via the Services may be reported and paid on an Oklahoma individual income tax return, currently Form 511 or by filing a consumer use tax return, currently Form 21-1. The referenced forms and corresponding instructions are available on the Oklahoma Tax Commission website. For South Dakota purchasers, any applicable sales or use taxes on purchases made via the Services may be reported and paid on a South Dakota Use Tax Form, currently Form 1350, available with corresponding instructions on the South Dakota Department of Revenue website.

For this purpose, Cleeng will act as the merchant of record on our request. The services of Cleeng are subject to the terms and conditions of Cleeng, located at https://cleeng.com/cleeng-user-agreement, which are hereby incorporated by reference (provided, however, that in the event of a conflict these Terms shall govern).

With respect to NHL.TV, the scheduled game may be blacked out and not available for viewing live if such game is being televised nationally in your country or programming area.

"Dispute" shall be defined as any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to the Services, these Terms, the Privacy Policy, other applicable NHL terms or policies, or your relationship with the NHL, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory ("Dispute"). Dispute shall be interpreted broadly. Dispute shall also include any dispute, claim, or controversy that arose before you assented to these Terms or after termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dispute shall not include disputes, claims, or controversies concerning patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Services. You or the NHL may seek interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction as needed to protect the status quo pending completion of arbitration. Mandatory Informal Pre-Dispute Resolution Process. Before initiating an arbitration proceeding, you or the NHL must give the other party notice of the Dispute by providing a written "Notice of Dispute" that is personally signed by you (if you are initiating the Notice of Dispute) or an NHL representative (if we are initiating the Notice of Dispute). The Notice of Dispute must contain the following information: (1) name, contact information (address, telephone number, and email address), and account information if applicable; (2) a detailed description of the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (3) a detailed description of the nature and basis of the relief sought, including a calculation for it. You must send any such Notice of Dispute to the NHL by email to [email protected]. We must send any such Notice of Dispute to you at the email address we have on file for you. You and the NHL agree to attempt to resolve the Dispute through informal, good faith negotiations for a sixty (60) day period from the date that a completed Notice of Dispute is received (or a longer period, if agreed to by the parties). If the party receiving the Notice of Dispute requests a telephone settlement conference as part of this informal process, you and the NHL agree to participate in an effort to resolve the Dispute. Should the NHL make this request, you agree to attend this conference (with your counsel, if you are represented). Should you make the request, the NHL agrees to have a representative attend this conference (with counsel, if the NHL is represented). Compliance with this "Mandatory Informal Pre-Dispute Resolution Process" is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Neither you nor the NHL may initiate an arbitration proceeding absent such compliance. If the sufficiency of a Notice of Dispute or compliance with this process is at issue, it may be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction at either party's election, and any arbitration proceeding shall be stayed. Such court shall have the authority to enforce this condition precedent to an arbitration proceeding, which includes the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of a demand for arbitration and the assessment and collection of arbitration administrative fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to raise non-compliance with this Mandatory Informal Pre-Dispute Resolution Process and seek relief in arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including the statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while you and the NHL engage in this Mandatory Informal Pre-Dispute Resolution Process in an effort to resolve the Dispute. Small Claims Court. Any Dispute that falls within the jurisdictional scope and limits of the small claims court where you reside must be brought in that court on an individual basis. Such Dispute must remain in small claims court and may not be removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. Arbitration Procedures. Except as otherwise provided herein, any Dispute that is not resolved through the Mandatory Informal Pre-Dispute Resolution Process or small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration to be held in the county or parish in which you reside. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and heard by a single, neutral arbitrator. The AAA shall administer the arbitration in accordance with the AAA's applicable rules including the supplementary rules ("AAA Rules"), as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org. If the AAA is unable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with these Terms, the parties shall agree on an alternative provider that will do so. If the parties cannot agree, they shall jointly petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration provider that will do so. The party seeking to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with the demand for arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules and these arbitration provisions. If you are initiating arbitration, you shall serve the demand on the NHL by email to [email protected]. If the NHL is initiating arbitration, the NHL shall serve the demand at the email address that we have on file for you. The demand for arbitration must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). By signing the demand for arbitration, that party (and their counsel, if represented) certifies that they have complied with (1) the Mandatory Informal Pre-Dispute Resolution Process (and they shall attach the Notice of Dispute) and (2) the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including that the claims and relief sought are neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to award any relief or impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or applicable federal or state law against all appropriate persons (including counsel) as a court would. The AAA Rules shall govern the payment of all arbitration fees. You and the NHL agree that arbitration is designed to be cost-effective for all parties. Either party may engage with the AAA to discuss fee reductions and deferred payments. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide except the following, which are for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide: (1) issues that are specifically reserved for a court in these Terms and (2) issues related to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provisions. The arbitrator may award relief, including, but not limited to, monetary, declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same individualized damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief necessary to provide relief as to the individualized claim. The arbitrator shall apply the cost-shifting provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 after entry of an award. Unless you and the NHL otherwise agree, one person's claims may not be consolidated with those of any other person. If a court determines that a claim or request for public injunctive relief may not be waived and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or it is otherwise final), you and the NHL agree that any claim or request for public injunctive relief shall be stayed and resolved by a court pending arbitration of the remaining claims and requests for relief. The decision of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall set forth the essential findings of fact and legal analysis. A judgment to enforce the award may be entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, however, any award that has been satisfied may not be filed or entered in court. The decision of the arbitrator shall have no preclusive effect in any proceeding involving non-identical parties. Each party reserves the right to request a telephonic, video, or in-person hearing from the arbitrator. You and the NHL's representative shall personally appear at any hearing ordered by the arbitrator (along with your and the NHL's counsel, if represented). For claims of more than $25,000 (and for claims seeking individualized injunctive, equitable, or declaratory relief that are not subject to small claims court as set forth above), a telephone, virtual, or in-person hearing shall be held and you and the NHL's representative shall personally appear (along with your and the NHL's counsel, if represented). The parties can agree to waive a hearing. Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings. The following provisions set forth additional procedures that apply to multiple case filings. If fifty (50) or more similar claims are asserted against the NHL by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (and your claim is one of them), you understand and agree that these additional procedures shall apply and the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed. Each case within any given stage shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. If your claim is not resolved as part of the staged process set forth above, either: OR Any relevant limitations period and filing fee or other deadlines shall be tolled subject to these Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings from the time the first cases are selected for a staged process until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment and collection of arbitration fees. If these Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with these Terms. โข Opt Out of Future Changes. If the NHL makes any future change to the arbitration provisions in this Section 18 (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending the NHL a personally signed, written notice of your decision to opt out of those changes by email to [email protected] within thirty (30) days of notice of the change and include your full name and your mailing address, telephone number, and email address, and a description of when and how you interacted with the NHL. Such opt out must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement that you wish to reject the change to the arbitration provisions. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS SECTION WILL NOT APPLY WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW (WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC). You and the NHL agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and the NHL may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and the NHL may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or the NHL may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and the NHL waive any right to a jury trial. Choice of Law and Venue. Subject to applicable law (which may include the Province of Quebec), these Terms and any Disputes between you and the NHL will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws. Unless you and the NHL agree otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (which may include the Province of Quebec), the state and federal courts of New York County, New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any Disputes between you and the NHL (except for Disputes brought in small claims court) that are not subject to arbitration or over any action involving the applicability or enforceability of any provisions of these Terms (including the arbitration provisions and class action waiver). You and the NHL consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts and waive any objections as to personal jurisdiction or as to the laying of venue in such courts due to inconvenient forum or any other basis to seek transfer or change venue of such action to another court.
