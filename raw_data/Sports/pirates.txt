Which types of tickets will be displayed in the MLB Ballpark app? The MLB Ballpark app displays regular season, Postseason, Spring Training and other event tickets within the Tickets tab’s Wallet.

No, to improve security and reduce the risk of ticket fraud, print-at-home tickets in any form are no longer accepted for entry at PNC Park. MLB BALLPARK APP - MOBILE TICKET BARCODE What is a Mobile Ticket Barcode? Each ticket has a mobile ticket barcode that must be scanned for entry into PNC Park via your mobile device. Within the Wallet, you can tap on an individual ticket to view its barcode. For entry to PNC Park, present your mobile device with the mobile barcode open and available to scan. How do I access the ticket to scan for entry? Tap on an individual ticket from the Tickets tab’s Wallet to pull up the mobile ticket barcode. The Section/Row/Seat and barcode will be displayed along with access to the terms and conditions governing your ticket. Why is my ticket barcode not showing in the MLB Ballpark app? There are several reasons why your barcode may not be available including that the ticket has been forwarded, the ticket had been forwarded to you and has since been canceled or recalled, or you are a group or suite buyer and the ticket status has changed. For mailed tickets, the ticket barcode will not appear until those tickets have been printed and mailed to you. For further assistance, contact Pirates Fans Services at [email protected] or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. I just forwarded a ticket via the MLB Ballpark app. Why do I still see it? Your ticket, without the barcode, will remain in your Tickets tab’s Wallet until your forward is accepted by the recipient. If you wish to cancel the forward, you can do that directly from the ticket. During what window of time can I forward tickets to friends? You can forward tickets via the MLB Ballpark app from the moment you purchase them until two hours after the first pitch of that day's game as long as that ticket has not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park. What should I do if I need to enter PNC Park for the start of the game and the rest of my group is not here yet? You can easily forward tickets to friends via the MLB Ballpark app up to two hours after the start of that day's game as long as the tickets have not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park. Can I use Apple Wallet for my Pirates tickets? Yes. From the bottom of the ticket inside the MLB Ballpark app you can tap the "Add to Wallet" button to add your ticket to Apple Wallet. Can I use Google Pay for my Pirates tickets? No. Support for adding tickets to Google Pay is not yet available from the MLB Ballpark app. Why won't my ticket barcode scan? If your screen brightness is too low, the barcode may have difficulty being scanned. The MLB Ballpark app will automatically attempt to increase the brightness of your display or you can do so manually by following the instructions for your device. Please note, cracked screens may impact your barcode's ability to scan. The barcode displayed is accompanied by a number. If there are difficulties reading a valid barcode on a digital ticket displayed within the MLB Ballpark app, visit the PNC Park Ticket Office. What if I lose connectivity after I've retrieved my tickets? As long as you have previously viewed your tickets, you will still be able to view your tickets in the MLB Ballpark app even with low connectivity. We recommend viewing and loading your tickets prior to arriving at PNC Park or adding to your Apple Wallet to ensure they are accessible regardless of connectivity. If I access my tickets from the MLB Ballpark app, can I still have them printed at a Will Call window? Since tickets retrieved within the MLB Ballpark app will now be considered printed, the tickets will not be available for pickup at Will Call. You should present the ticket displayed in the MLB Ballpark app on your mobile device for entry at the gate. If you are unable to access your ticket, go to a Ticket Office window for assistance on game day. If you have any questions, please contact Pirates Fans Services at [email protected] or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. What do I do if my mobile device's battery dies? Visit the nearest PNC Park Ticket Office window for assistance. MLB BALLPARK APP - TICKET FORWARDING What is Ticket Forwarding? The MLB Ballpark app allows you to easily forward tickets to family, friends, colleagues, account partners and others with whom you wish to share your tickets so that they can use their ticket on their personal phone. How do I forward a ticket? From the Tickets tab’s Wallet tap on a game to access a list of your tickets. At the bottom of the list tap "Forward Ticket". Select the ticket(s) you wish to forward then choose "Select From Contacts", "Via Email", or “Share Link’. Selecting "Forward Ticket" again prompts you to enter an email address or choose a friend from your Address Book. You can then add the recipient's name (optional) and a message (optional) before tapping "Send" to complete the forward. If you wish to send by another method, you can tap "Share Link" which will provide you a unique link to share.

No. At this time, "My Pirates Tickets" contacts will not automatically link to the MLB Ballpark app. However, the MLB Ballpark app will automatically link to the address book and contacts in your mobile device. How does Forwarding a Ticket via "Share Link" work? A unique link, which holds the key to your ticket, will be generated and you can distribute it as you see fit. Please only share this link with one person to whom you are forwarding your ticket. If you share the link with multiple recipients, whomever clicks that link and completes the "forward accept" process first will get that ticket. What if I accidentally send the ticket to the wrong email address? You can easily cancel a ticket forward that is in a pending state directly from your list of tickets inside the Wallet. You can then resend the ticket to the correct email address. How will my recipient know I forwarded tickets? Both you and the recipient will receive an email that notifies that the ticket forward has been initiated. The recipient will have a unique link in the email to accept the ticket. If you selected "Share Link," the recipient will receive the notification by whatever method you selected for delivering the link. How do I accept a ticket forward? You must click "Accept" from the email invitation you received. If you do not already have the MLB Ballpark app on your supported iOS or Android device, you will be prompted to download the app. I do not have a supported iOS or Android device. Can I still accept a ticket forward? Yes, you can accept and receive your tickets in a standard web browser. Once a ticket forward has been accepted, contact Pirates Fans Services at [email protected] or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. What if the email address where I received the ticket forward is not the same as the email address associated with my MLB account? The email address at which you received your tickets does not need to match the email address associated with your MLB account, but you will be required to click the link in the email where the ticket was forwarded to. Can I reject a ticket forward? Yes, just click, "I do not want to accept this ticket" on the Ticket Accept webpage. This webpage is accessible only from the ticket forward email sent to the recipient. The sender of the ticket forward will be informed that the invitation was rejected and will continue to have access to the ticket in their MLB Ballpark app If I receive a forwarded ticket, can I re-forward that ticket to another recipient? Yes, a ticket can be forwarded again. Each time a ticket is forwarded, the two participants, the sender and the recipient, will receive a notification of this transaction Can I cancel a Pirates ticket forward? Yes, the sender can cancel a ticket forward any time before the barcode has been scanned. This can be accomplished from the Wallet tab by selecting an individual ticket and tapping "Cancel" or by clicking on the Ticket Forward icon at the top of the Wallet tab. Select the specific Forward then tap "Cancel Forward." The recipient of the ticket you forwarded will be notified. Can I cancel or recall a Pirates ticket forward after it has been accepted? Yes, the original ticket sender can cancel or recall a ticket forward after it has been accepted. The sender and recipient will be notified by email of this action and the ticket will disappear from the recipient's (or anyone they may have forwarded it to) Wallet tab. However, once the ticket has been scanned for entry, the ticket cannot be recalled. Can I cancel a Pirates ticket forward after it has been accepted and re-sent? Yes, the original ticket owner can cancel the forward for a ticket to a Pirates home game regardless of how many times it has been re-forwarded as long as it has not been scanned for entry yet. The sender and original recipient will be notified by email of this action, and the ticket will disappear from the Wallet Tab and/or My Pirates Tickets account of whomever the ticket had last been forwarded to. Can I forward multiple Pirates tickets to a single account? Yes. Tickets can be forwarded together from the same event or one ticket at a time. Where can I find the status of all Pirates Ticket Forwards? You can navigate to the Ticket Forward icon at the top of the Wallet tab. There, you will find all received and sent ticket forwards for your account. What if I never received the Ticket Forward email? If you are expecting to receive a ticket forward but were never notified by email, contact the sender. The sender can cancel the current Ticket Forward then re-send to you by email or share link. If you or the sender are still having difficulties, contact Pirates Fans Services at [email protected] or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. If the person I forward tickets to deletes the email they received to accept the ticket(s) before they click "Accept," what should I do? The ticket owner should cancel their original ticket forward and then re-forward the ticket via the MLB Ballpark app so the recipient receives a new email through which to accept the ticket(s).

His 10-year stint in the Bucs front office included work in the Marketing, Public Relations and Broadcasting departments. Greg also served as the team’s public address announcer during the 1987 campaign. In 1988, he was a sports anchor on WFMJ-TV in Youngstown, OH.

He also worked as a color analyst and a pre and postgame show host for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League for five seasons (1989-93).

Brown is a native of Washington, D.C. He currently resides in Renfrew, PA, with his wife, Kim, and their son. Joe Block Joe Block is in his ninth season of calling Pirates play-by-play action, having joined the TV and radio broadcast teams in 2016. Though having grown up in and outside Detroit, Block considers making his home in Pittsburgh “a dream,” as his grandparents and great-grandparents originally settled in the region, in Wheeling, WV and Byesville, OH. As a teenager, Block traveled to Pittsburgh on spring break to take in Penguins games at the Igloo. Block has called baseball for 20 seasons, previously with the Milwaukee Brewers and in the minor leagues in Billings, MT, Great Falls, MT, Jacksonville, FL, St. Paul, MN, and Charleston, SC.

He made his big league debut with the Phillies in 1980 and was the starting pitcher in Game One of the World Series that October against Kansas City. In the spring of 1981, Walk was dealt to the Atlanta Braves for outfielder Gary Matthews. He spent three seasons in the Atlanta organization before being acquired by Pittsburgh in 1984. Bob was a 1988 National League All-Star and he posted six straight winning seasons from 1987 to 1992. One of his finest moments in a Pirates uniform came in 1992 when he pitched a 7-1, complete-game victory over the Atlanta Braves in Game Five of the National League Championship Series.

PNC PARK FEATURES The Ballpark PNC Park, which opened in spring 2001, is a classic-style ballpark, an intimate facility that embraces the progressiveness of Pittsburgh while saluting the spirit of early ballpark originals such as Forbes Field, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park. It is the fifth home of the Pittsburgh Pirates since their inception in 1887. This riverfront facility combines the best features of yesterday's ballparks - rhythmic archways, steel trusswork and a natural grass playing field - with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort. Location PNC Park's prime location along the shore of the Allegheny River and adjacent to Federal Street takes advantage of scenic vistas of the downtown skyline and riverfront, as well as pedestrian and riverboat access, creating an exciting and dramatic urban sports venue. It also provides easy access for pedestrians crossing the Roberto Clemente bridge from downtown, as well as those arriving from the riverwalk. On game days, the bridge is closed off to vehicular traffic and spectators are met by a dynamic interactive retail/restaurant and sports pavilion beyond right field, with attractions for all ages. Design The facility was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum (HOK), Inc. out of Kansas City, MO. The design and construction management team consisted of a joint venture between Pittsburgh-based Dick Corporation and Barton Malow with offices in Baltimore, MD. The Architect of Record was L.D. Astorino & Associates of Pittsburgh. PNC Park is the first ballpark with a two-deck design to be built in the United States since Milwaukee's County Stadium was completed in 1953. Because of its intimate design, the highest seat is just 88 feet from the field, giving every fan in the park an ideal sight line. PNC Park is approachable and pedestrian in scale. Designed to fit within the existing city grid, it is also orientated to allow a great majority of spectators a spectacular view of the Clemente Bridge and the downtown skyline beyond. The home of the Pirates is instantly recognizable as a ballpark, with architectural flourishes of Forbes Field lending a touch of nostalgia. The series of masonry archways extending along the entry level facade and decorative terra cotta tiled pilasters exude the charm of the club's former home of 61 years. Features Among the features of the beautiful facility are 69 suites with their own concourse level, club seating at both the field and mezzanine levels with their own respective lounges, an outfield barbecue run by former Pirate Manny Sanguillen, an outdoor river terrace and river walk. PNC Park also features the Left Field Lounge & Jim Beam Porch, offering a casual dining and sports bar atmosphere with wait service before, during and after every game for all ticket holders. The ballpark houses retail areas along the Federal Street and General Robinson Street corridor, including Slice on Broadway, the Pirates Clubhouse Store, PNC Bank and the Pirates administrative and ticket offices. Playing Field The irregularly shaped, natural grass playing field measures 325 feet down the left foul line and 389 feet through the left field power alley. The park reaches its greatest distance of 410 feet at a nook located just left of center field. The distance down the right field foul line is 320 feet, 375 feet down the power alley, and 399 feet to center field. The outfield wall rises up to 21 feet behind right field (in honor of the Pirates legendary right fielder #21, Roberto Clemente) and drops down to just six feet in front of the left field bleachers. From home plate to the Allegheny River is 443 feet, 4 inches. The Pirates and the Park Perhaps the strongest inspiration for PNC Park's design is the legacy of the Pirates themselves. Few cities can boast of a 115-year relationship with the same Major League ballclub. Pittsburgh deserves nothing less than a ballpark classic that will enthrall fans for generations to come.

These trees were planted in underserved communities and targeted historically marginalized neighborhoods because research shows these neighborhoods are more susceptible to "heat island impacts," which can cause impaired water quality, increased energy consumption, and compromised health quality. The neighborhoods are urban areas with buildings, roads, and other infrastructure that absorb the suns heat more than naturally landscaped areas. This causes the neighborhoods to become "islands" of higher temperatures relative to outlying areas. Pittsburgh Pirates continue to maintain the PNC Park Urban Garden. The Urban Garden uses sustainable practices and provides vegetables and herbs, grown on-site, to be used in Pirates players' favorite healthy dishes prepared by the Pirates Executive Chef Tony Palatucci. Just like families at home, our Pirates family works hard each season to reduce, reuse and recycle, not just on Earth Day, but every day. In over a decade of sustainability efforts at PNC Park, the Pirates and our partners have recycled... 1,825 Tons That’s the equivalent weight of over 200 T-Rex dinos! 219 Tons This oil is recycled and eventually used as biofuel. 2,492 Tons Including electronics, toner cartridges, metal, batteries, and more. 793 Tons Including 1.3 million plastic bottles used by fans each season. 206 Tons Plus, all paper in the front office is at least 30% post-consumer material. 521 Tons Since we have started recycling, we have recycled 521 tons of aluminum. 9,171 Tons 2,037 Tons What is composting, anyway? Composting is organic recycling. Composting allows for the controlled collection of food & organic material, rather than waste-producing methane gas during decomposition in landfills. Direct benefits to soil include increased aeration and structural stability, improved activity of beneficial micro-organisms, faster root development, and ultimately higher yields of agricultural crops. Consider this: If just 25 Pirates fans diverted their food waste to composting for one year, it would equal eliminating the emissions from a 6,000-mile train trip! Over 29,450 pounds of food was donated between Pirates Executive Chef Tony and Aramark to 412 Food Rescue in 2023. The Pirates sustainability practices successfully divert more than 70-percent of the ballpark waste out of the waste stream each year, equivalent to more than 1,650 tons of materials.

EXPERIENCE HISTORY AT PNC PARK Take a walk along the streets right outside PNC Park and discover four legends forever immortalized with a statue. FEDERAL STREET Along Federal Street, you'll find: The Roberto Clemente statue was dedicated on July 8, 1994, to kick off All-Star Week in Pittsburgh. It was originally erected outside Gate A at Three Rivers Stadium and is now located outside the Center Field Gate to PNC Park, a few steps away from the Roberto Clemente Bridge. Unveiled on April 7, 2001, the 12-foot bronze statue stands along Federal Street at the entrance to left field at PNC Park. MAZEROSKI WAY On Mazeroski Way, you'll find: As part of the 50th anniversary season of the 1960 World Series Championship, the 12-foot bronze statue was officially unveiled on September 5, 2010, and stands at the end of Mazeroski Way, which is located at the right field entrance to PNC Park. At the corner of Mazeroski Way and General Robinson Street, you’ll find: The Honus Wagner statue has had three different “homes” since being dedicated on April 30, 1955. Originally, the Wagner statue was located in Schenley Park, close to the Pirates early home, Forbes Field. It was then moved to Three Rivers Stadium and erected outside Gate C on July 21, 1972. The statue is now located at the home plate entrance to PNC Park.

JIM LEYLAND NATIONAL BASEBALL HOF TRAVEL PACKAGES Jim Leyland was elected to the Hall of Fame by the Contemporary Era Committee, which is composed of seven Hall of Fame members, six long-time baseball executives and three media members/historians. Leyland, who managed 11 of his 22 years as a member of the Pirates, will be the 44th former player, manager or executive in the Hall of Fame who spent some of their professional careers with the Pirates, including 2013 Pre-Integration Era inductee Deacon White, who played for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys in 1889. Fourteen of the other 43 spent a majority of their career with the Pirates, including Jake Beckley, Max Carey, Fred Clarke, Roberto Clemente, owner Barney Dreyfuss, Ralph Kiner, Bill Mazeroski, Willie Stargell, Pie Traynor, Arky Vaughan, Honus Wagner, Lloyd Waner and Paul Waner. Leyland managed the Pirates from 1986-96 and led the team to three straight appearances in the National League Championship Series from 1990-92. During his 11 years as manager of the Pirates, Leyland compiled a record of 851-863 while being named the BBWAA Manager-of-the-Year in both 1990 and 1992. He also garnered Manager-of-the-Year accolades with Detroit in 2006. Leyland’s 851 wins as manager of the Pirates rank third all-time in team history, trailing only Fred Clarke (1422) and Danny Murtaugh (1115). He ranks 18th all-time in big league history in managerial wins with 1769 during his time with Pittsburgh, Florida, Colorado, and Detroit. Leyland won a World Series championship with the Marlins in 1997 and managed the United States to the 2017 World Baseball Classic championship. He is the only manager in history to win both titles.

MLB Authentication Hologram Authentication Enter your two-letter prefix followed by the hologram number. Example: CV123456 Hologram Information Off-duty law enforcement officers working as independent contractors are assigned by Authenticators, Inc. to authenticate autographs and game-used memorabilia at every Major League Baseball game. Only those items that an authenticator actually witnesses being signed or used in a game may be eligible for authentication under the MLB Authentication Program. Once witnessed, authenticated items receive a tamper-proof hologram created by OpSec, U.S. with a unique alphanumeric combination to easily identify their authenticity. Hologram introduced in 2022: Program Information The Major League Baseball Authentication Program is the most comprehensive league-wide memorabilia authentication initiative in professional sports. Since its launch in 2001, it has become the industry standard for autographed and game-used sports memorabilia authentication. Designed to distinguish officially authenticated MLB memorabilia from other items on the market, the program offers an objective third-party authentication system that guarantees genuine memorabilia for all MLB fans. Major League Baseball Properties schedules third-party authenticators from Authenticators, Inc. for every MLB game. Only those items that an authenticator actually witnesses being signed or used in a game may be eligible for authentication under the MLB Authentication Program. Once witnessed, items receive a tamper-proof hologram created by OpSec, U.S. with a unique alphanumeric combination to easily identify its authenticity. Authenticated items are offered to key retail partners of Major League Baseball Properties or on MLB.com. Fans can easily distinguish officially authenticated MLB memorabilia from other items by locating the official authentication hologram. Once fans receive their authenticated piece of memorabilia, they can trace the unique serial number on the Authentication database located on MLB.com. This convenient reference database enables fans to easily identify all of the details surrounding their new item. Since its inception in 2001, the Major League Baseball Authentication Program is responsible for authenticating over six million items, allowing fans to ensure their memorabilia is a 100% genuine piece of their favorite pastime. It's easy to get the real goods; just check for the official seal of authentication. Holograms used from 2006 to present: Hologram Details Holograms used from 2001 to 2005: In this period, Deloitte & Touche was solely responsible for the authentication of all items authenticated under the auspices of the MLB Authentication Program. In order to ensure the security of items authenticated under the MLB Authentication Program, holograms are designed to show traces of tampering if a hologram is removed. In addition to the holograms featured on authenticated memorabilia, different holograms are produced by OpSec, U.S. for use on Major League Baseball Properties licensed products. These holograms, also with unique alphanumeric combinations, allow fans to easily identify merchandise as officially licensed by MLBP. These holograms are NOT used for the authentication of game-used or autographed products and, therefore, will not show up on the verification system located on MLB.com/authentication. We do not appraise or attach values to any memorabilia. Unfortunately, we do not authenticate past autographs or game-used items. Currently, our system only authenticates items that are directly witnessed by a designated MLB Authenticator at the moment it is signed or used and only in conjunction with a Club or MLB Authentication Licensee. The DB numbered hologram is not an authentication hologram; it is a hologram that designates the item as officially licensed. This hologram is never used for authentication by the MLB Authentication program for any autographed or game-used items. Authentication holograms are placed directly on the items themselves. If you have an item which does not appear in the system, please e-mail an image of the hologram and a brief description and image of your item to [email protected]. Once we receive the image we will investigate the matter and get back to you as soon as possible.

Pirates' Spring Training homes sustain damage after Hurricane Milton Pirates' Spring Training homes sustain damage after Hurricane Milton Alex Stumpf The Pirates' Spring Training homes of LECOM Park and Pirate City in Bradenton, Fla., sustained damage late Wednesday night as Hurricane Milton tore through Florida’s Gulf Coast. Both facilities are standing, but the batter’s eye and fencing between fields at Pirate City, as well as the outfield wall at LECOM Park, were among the damage that hit Bradenton and its neighboring cities. “While we appreciate the curiosity, this pales in comparison to what others are facing in the wake of both Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton,” senior vice president of communications and broadcasting Brian Warecki said in a released statement. “We continue to work alongside Bradenton area first responders and willing to help in any way we can.” The Pirates split their time each spring between the two locations, first opening at Pirate City before moving to LECOM Park at the start of the Grapefruit League season. After the Major League camp leaves for LECOM Park, Minor League Spring Training takes over at Pirate City. The expectation is that the Bradenton facilities will be ready for a normal Spring Training. The Pirates’ first home Spring Training game is set for Feb. 23 against the Twins. You can join MLB in supporting recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton.

Bucs' No. 3 prospect among Pirates' Arizona Fall League crew Bucs' No. 3 prospect among Pirates' Arizona Fall League crew Jonathan Mayo Baseball can be a humbling sport, and there’s no question Termarr Johnson has learned that over his two-plus years of pro ball since the Pirates took him No. 4 overall in the 2022 Draft. But thankfully, it’s done nothing to dampen his confidence. “I'm just trying to continue to do whatever I can to continue to make sure that I'm in the best position possible, because I know I'm the best hitter in the world,” said the Pirates' No. 3 prospect (MLB No. 75) after he went 2-for-4 with a home run in his AFL debut for the Scottsdale Scorpions. More on the Arizona Fall League:• Complete coverage | Schedule | Tickets | Teams | Shop He knows there’s work to be done. Though he did reach Double-A at age 20, Johnson sports a career .239/.390/.406 line over 252 Minor League games. He has shown plenty of discipline at the plate (18.6 percent walk rate), but even he would admit that the strikeouts (23.6 percent) have come a little more frequently than expected. “I learned a lot,” Johnson said about his 2024 season. “It was just fun learning a lot about myself. I'm very happy with what I've done, but I'm always hungry for more. Even if I was batting .400, I’d probably want more than that, too. I'm happy for what I did do, happy for my teammates, and all the games that I helped them win. But I want to do more, so I’m excited for that.” That’s a big reason why he’s fired up about getting to extend his season this fall. There were some improvements at the plate for the left-handed hitter in 2024, including his K rate dropping to 21.3 percent. He’s clearly not satisfied with where he is, even with his strong sense of self, realizing that his experience with the Scorpions will only help him down the future. “I want to learn more about myself that’s going to help me be the best big leaguer I can be,” Johnson said. “I want to be the best player on the field every time that I’m out there. Learning from my teammates here, learning from my coaches here, learning from the experience here is going to help me get to that.” One thing that has helped him get to that along the way has been his brother’s music. Terrenz Johnson, often performing under the name Levels, has produced tunes that have served as his brother’s walk-up music. AFL fans could be treated to some new selections, though it appears that the league does not offer music for hitters as is now customary during the regular season. “Oh yeah, if they do a walk up song here, I'll try to debut a few,” Johnson said. “He has a lot of songs for me that I can use for my walk up, and I'm very excited about that.” Pirates hitters in the Fall League Kervin Pichardo, INF: Originally signed by the Phillies in June of 2019, Pichardo was first sent to the Padres in a March 2022 trade, then was on the move again this past April to the Pirates in return for lefty Jackson Wolf. Playing every day for the first time, Pichardo showed off an intriguing combination of swing decisions and athleticism with Double-A Altoona while being able to play three infield positions capably. Geovanny Planchart, C: Planchart joined the organization near the end of the 2018-19 international signing period for just $41,000. Since then, he’s established a reputation for being a glove-first backstop. Though he’s yet to show much production with the bat, he did reach Double-A for the first time this season ahead of his 23rd birthday. Have the latest news, ticket information, and more from the Pirates and MLB delivered right to your inbox. Sammy Siani, OF: Taken No. 37 overall in the 2019 Draft, the younger brother of Cardinals outfielder Michael Siani struggled for much of his two first full seasons of pro ball. A change to his swing path -- he’s much less steep now -- led to his first prolonged success with High-A Greensboro, and he earned a promotion to Double-A. He’s making a lot more contact now and trying to carry over that success to the AFL, where his speed and above-average defense should also be on display. Pirates pitchers in the Fall League Khristian Curtis, RHP (No. 27): While injuries have plagued him in both college and in 2024, the Pirates’ 12th-round pick in 2023 has shown the ability to miss bats when he’s been on the mound. His fastball velocity took a nice jump this year, averaging 95.4 mph with Single-A Bradenton with much more vertical break. Curtis has a full array of secondary offerings in a cutter, changeup and two distinct breaking balls, and he just needs more mound time to trust his stuff and find the strike zone more consistently. Derek Diamond, RHP: A sixth-round pick by the Pirates out of Mississippi in 2022, Diamond has shown the ability to throw a ton of strikes over two years of pro ball, walking just 2.1 per nine in his career and only 1.8/9 in 2024 with High-A Greensboro. The Pirates like his bulldog mentality, and he’s working on his pitch design to build off that foundation of finding the zone as he reaches the upper levels. Valentin Linarez, RHP: Signed back in January of 2018 for $45,000, Linarez was developed as a starter before moving to the bullpen in 2023. He started to figure some things out with High-A Greensboro this year, striking out 15.3 per nine to earn his first promotion to Double-A. He’s imposing at 6-foot-5 with the chance to have a fastball-slider combination that could look good coming out of a big league bullpen. Eddy Yean, RHP: If Yean’s improvements in 2024 are for real, Pirates fans could see him help out the big league bullpen in 2025. He has an upper-90s turbo sinker that plays well and his nasty slider complements it. He’s an imposing presence on the mound who did a much better job of throwing strikes this past season, the biggest reason for his improved performance this year.

Coaching-staff changes and more offseason questions for Bucs Coaching-staff changes and more offseason questions for Bucs Alex Stumpf This story was excerpted from Alex Stumpf’s Pirates Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. After failing to improve on their 76-86 record from 2023, the Pirates will enter a pivotal offseason with plenty of questions. Here are five of the most burning ones as they begin to look towards '25. 1. Who will be their hitting and bullpen coaches? Let’s start with a couple of changes we know will need to be made. The Pirates are moving on from hitting coach Andy Haines and bullpen coach Justin Meccage after the hitters and relievers generally underproduced in 2024, finishing 27th in the Majors in team OPS (.672) and reliever ERA (4.49). • What we learned from Pirates' 2024 season There are many talented pitching coaches through the Pirates' system -- like Cibney Bello and Drew Benes with Triple-A Indianapolis, for example -- if they opt for some familiarity as they graduate more young pitchers to the Majors. Pittsburgh is probably best off with an external hire for hitting coach, and the club will have to find someone who can help maximize their young hitters making the jump to the Majors. 2. How do you fix the bullpen? General manager Ben Cherington said he believes David Bednar could be the Pirates’ closer next year. Bednar's return to All-Star form would be better than any external move the Pirates could make to improve their bullpen, but how many eggs can they put in that basket? Can they part with Aroldis Chapman, who can close if necessary, with Bednar as a question mark? There’s also a depth problem. Dennis Santana was a great midseason pickup, but the Pirates didn’t have much consistency from their other middle or leverage relievers like Colin Holderman, Carmen Mlodzinski and Kyle Nicolas. Dauri Moreta should be back from Tommy John surgery midseason, but Pittsburgh needs more pitchers it can turn to in leverage spots. The club also also needs a quality lefty specialist, a piece that was missing this past season. The Pirates can make minor trades or a signing or two to improve the depth, but if they are looking for guys who can pitch the seventh and eighth, will they make another splash like they did with Chapman? 3. What do you do at first base? The offense’s issues extend beyond first base, but it’s been an issue for several years now. The Pirates have a couple of players on the 40-man roster who could play first base -- namely Billy Cook, Jared Triolo, Connor Joe and Endy Rodríguez -- but none scream “everyday option.” Cook’s outfield glovework was outstanding in his month in the Majors (six Defensive Runs Saved), so he’s probably suited better there. Joe struggled in the second half of the season, Triolo’s defensive versatility is a huge plus for him and Rodríguez is working to come back as a catcher. Bryan Reynolds took infield drills with a first-base glove several times throughout September, and while Cherington said the team will be open-minded to potentially moving him to first, they haven’t had any formal discussions. The free-agent market for first basemen is thin. If the Pirates want to add an impact player to this group, it might have to be via trade. 4. Who is the catcher? Joey Bart was a pleasant surprise, hitting 13 home runs with a .799 OPS in 80 games played. Does that make him the starting catcher next year? Rodríguez should be healthy, and it’s still too soon to close the book on Henry Davis. This will probably be sorted out more over the course of Spring Training, but each of these players could theoretically move to another position too. Davis has some right-field experience, Rodríguez could move to first and it’s not unreasonable to assume Bart could move too, if necessary. Playing time could be sorted out later, but how much playing opportunity should the Pirates allocate to their catchers? Have the latest news, ticket information, and more from the Pirates and MLB delivered right to your inbox. 5. How aggressive will they be? Time will tell here. Free agency hasn’t started and the trade market is virtually non-existent until November. But 2025 is going to be a pivotal season. Will the Pirates make a splash in the free-agent market or listen on trade offers for top prospects? They were willing to deal from their starting-pitching depth at the Trade Deadline to try to bolster their offensive options. Will they do that again, and if so, do they up the ante? There are holes at first base, the bullpen and maybe shortstop or the outfield, depending how this offseason goes. The Pirates have internal options, but if they want to get better, it’s going to take adding players too.

==================================================

Best hitter in the world? Bucs prospect will do whatever it takes Best hitter in the world? Bucs prospect will do whatever it takes Jim Callis SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- One of the biggest names in the Arizona Fall League gave fans a thrill and a scare in his opening game Tuesday night. Termarr Johnson led off against right-hander Dylan Ray (Diamondbacks) by taking two called strikes and a ball before staying back perfectly on a changeup and crushing it 393 feet to right field for a home run. The Pirates' No. 3 prospect also singled in his second plate appearance and walked in his third en route to a 2-for-4 night. More on the Arizona Fall League:• Complete coverage | Schedule | Tickets | Teams | Shop Johnson's performance helped the Scottsdale Scorpions to a 9-8 victory over the Salt River Rafters, but he exited early with what initially looked like a potentially serious injury. Batting in the top of the eighth, he viciously swung through a 1-1 changeup from left-hander Evan Justice (Rockies) and immediately couldn't put any weight on his right foot. After consulting with Scottsdale's trainers, he had to be carried off the field. It was just a severe cramp in his right leg, though. Johnson recovered in time to celebrate the win by doing the Griddy in the postgame handshake line. "I guess I had a lot of movement today and I've just got to make sure that I do a better job before and get some food under me," Johnson said. "It was only a cramp. I took a pretty good hack at a pitch up and I had a calf just lock up on me. I've had a couple of those before and it just locked up real quick." Johnson said he'd be ready to play in Scottsdale's game Wednesday if needed. More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage The fourth overall pick in the 2022 Draft out of Mays High School in Atlanta, Johnson was one of the most hyped high school hitters in recent years. Some scouts put a top-of-the-scale 80 grade on his hitting ability, and one evaluator said Johnson combined Wade Boggs' plate discipline with Vladimir Guerrero Sr.'s bat-to-ball skills. Johnson still has impressive hand-eye coordination and a quick left-handed swing, but it hasn't quite translated as expected in pro ball. He slashed .239/.390/.386 in 252 games over three seasons, showing solid power potential and drawing plenty of walks but also striking out a surprisingly high 24 percent rate. To his credit, Johnson has advanced rapidly -- the 20-year-old reached Double-A by the end of this season. He still ranks No. 75 on  MLB Pipeline's Top 100 Prospects list. And his belief in himself has not waned. "I'm happy for what I've done," Johnson said. "I'm working on being a better baseball player, and it looks exactly how it's supposed to look. I'm just trying to continue to do whatever I can to continue to make sure that I'm in the best position possible, because I know I'm the best hitter in the world. "Me continuing to work on me being the best in the world is very important to me. So whatever it takes, honestly, if it's [hitting] .500 or if it's .060 in order for me to be the best hitter in the world, it is what it is. I just got to make sure that I do my part."

That duo has already combined for three homers this fall, with Isaac crushing two in his first four games.

How mother's request changed Ortiz's life How mother's request changed Ortiz's life Alex Stumpf This story was excerpted from Alex Stumpf’s Pirates Beat newsletter. To read the full newsletter, click here. And subscribe to get it regularly in your inbox. Luis Ortiz headed home to San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic to comfort his grieving mother, who was mourning the loss of her mother. His life was going through a pretty seismic change around that time too, but that was secondary to being there for his family. His mother, Damaris, was more worried about him, though. Crying, she had one request: “Can you please play baseball for one more week?” Ortiz had just given up on his dream of pitching in the Major Leagues shortly before his grandmother passed, frustrated after being let go by several teams. Now 19 years old, he was ready to start a new chapter, but agreed to give it one more week. He was discovered by the Pirates shortly thereafter and signed. His career had a second life. “When I signed, I promised I was not going to let her down,” Ortiz said, via Pirates interpreter and coach Stephen Morales. “I was going to do whatever possible to put her in a good spot.” Ortiz has done just that. When the right-hander finally landed stateside, he rapidly rose through the ranks of professional baseball, going from Single-A Bradenton at the end of the 2021 season to pitching in Yankee Stadium in September of '22. Now 25, Ortiz has grown into one of the team’s most talented young pitchers who is poised to be part of their staff for years to come. He owes that to his mother for giving him a second chance to follow his dream. In fact, he wouldn’t have had that first chance without her either. Ortiz loved playing growing up, but had to give it up when he was 15. His family needed money and baseball was too much of a luxury at the time, so he got into construction and started picking oranges at Hato Mayor. “There was no money [in baseball],” Ortiz said. “The money situation in my family was pretty bad.” Damaris wanted him to pursue his dream, though, and after Ortiz moved in with her about two years later, she had taken jobs working in a factory and housekeeping. She was determined to give him that shot. “She was doing everything in her power to get me that little bit of money to get me back to baseball,” Ortiz said. It worked. Ortiz quit his jobs and signed with the Giants, but the jump to pro ball was not kind. He played the infield as a child, but wanted to go pro as a pitcher. The Giants gave him that chance, but after about nine months, they let him go. Ortiz bounced around a couple Dominican Academies in the following year to similar results. He had talent, but it wasn’t coming together, and after the Brewers let him go, he was convinced it was time to go back to construction and the orange fields. “I love baseball, it’s what I wanted to do, but it was rough,” Ortiz said. Had it not been for his grandmother passing, that likely would have been the end of his baseball journey. Instead, he found himself with the Pirates in October of 2018. They were more patient than the other teams had been. Ortiz was more motivated, too, and he grew into more fastball ve5locity. After he started throwing both a four-seam and two-seam fastball, his career started to take off. “All those other experiences with the other teams helped me grow a lot,” Ortiz said. “I knew I had a willpower to make sure this time was the right time. Focus on hard work. That’s what got me here.” Damaris and Ortiz’s father, Luis Antonio, watch every start he makes and text him afterwards. There should be plenty of starts to come, especially since Ortiz has elevated himself from the bullpen to being part of the regular rotation for most of the season. That success he’s enjoyed in his first full Major League season -- he posted a 3.22 ERA in 15 starts after beginning the year in the bullpen -- is a product of his hard work, but also the support he has from his loved ones. “My family has been a huge part of my career,” Ortiz said. “They’re always pushing me to be the best. There’s some other [people] that try to put negative stuff in your mind and that you’re not going to make it and you’re going to go back to work at home. It has been a tough road, but I’m really grateful that my family is still here for me.”

Keep your eyes on these AFL sleepers -- one from each MLB organization Keep your eyes on these AFL sleepers -- one from each MLB organization Sam Dykstra Jim Callis Jonathan Mayo The Arizona Fall League is often called a showcase circuit or prospect graduating school – a place where the Minors’ top talents gather for six weeks in the Valley of the Sun to compete before putting their stamps on the Majors. But the six AFL rosters aren’t loaded with Top 100 overall and Top 30 organizational prospects alone. There are under-the-radar names playing in the desert too, hoping to make a name for themselves both within their own systems and across the industry at large. Or at least they’re under the radar for now. More on the Arizona Fall League:• Complete coverage | Schedule | Tickets | Teams | Shop Here is one prospect ranked outside his organization’s Top 30 to keep an eye on during this Arizona Fall League season: Jump to: AL East | AL Central | AL West | NL East | NL Central | NL West  AMERICAN LEAGUE EAST Blue Jays: Adrian Pinto, 2B/OFRanked No. 30 on our preseason Blue Jays list, Pinto fell off after opening the season on the IL with a rib issue and playing only 26 games in the regular season, 17 with High-A Vancouver. He was effective in that time, going 21-for-70 (.300) with three homers, 12 total extra-base hits and only 10 strikeouts. That power is especially impressive for a prospect who is thought to be a high-contact, good-speed type and stands only 5-foot-6 in the box. Pinto needs reps to elbow his way back into the Top 30 and will get them with Scottsdale. Orioles: Jake Cunningham, OFRanked No. 147 on MLB Pipeline’s Top 250 Draft prospects list ahead of the 2023 Draft, Cunningham was taken in the fifth round (No. 154 overall) by the Orioles and signed for just under slot ($375K). He entered pro ball with a reputation for having a power-speed combination and with some questions about his hit tool. Those remain, as he has work to do with his approach, and the power didn’t show up in his first full season. The speed did (29 steals) and he did hit better when he moved up to High-A Aberdeen to finish his first full season while showing he can play all three outfield spots well. Rays: T.J. Fondtain, LHPFondtain was the 2023 Mountain West pitcher of the year after posting a 2.82 ERA with 99 strikeouts in 92⅔ innings for San Diego State and was even a John Olerud Two-Way Player of the Year finalist as well. He was fastball-heavy as an Aztecs junior (79 percent usage) but only sat in the upper 80s, causing him to fall to the Rays in the 14th round. Tampa Bay used him primarily as a reliever at High-A Bowling Green, where he showed increased velo and finished with a 3.38 ERA, 0.91 WHIP, 67 strikeouts and only 13 walks in 61⅓ frames. A quality fading changeup helped Fondtain post a stellar split against righties (.171 average, .542 OPS in 160 plate appearances), and his control could open up an avenue for the 23-year-old to return to starting. Red Sox: Tyler Uberstine, RHPUberstine maxed out at 75 mph with his fastball in high school and pitched for the club team at Southern California but couldn't make the Trojans' varsity. After he improved his delivery and stuff working with former big leaguer Joe Biemel, he cracked Northwestern's roster and the Red Sox drafted him in the 19th round in 2021. Now he operates in the low 90s with his two- and four-seam fastballs and in the low 80s with his sweeper. He had Tommy John surgery in June 2023 and returned to the mound this August, working 4 2/3 innings at High-A. More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage Yankees: Jackson Fristoe, RHPPart of Mississippi State's 2021 College World Series championship team, Fristoe has stood out more for his stuff than his polish in college and since turning pro as a 12th-rounder in 2022. He has good metrics on his mid-90s fastball and mid-80s sweeper, and he posted a 3.79 ERA with 40 strikeouts in 38 High-A innings this year while dealing with some shoulder issues.  AMERICAN LEAGUE CENTRAL Guardians: Dylan DeLucia, RHPDeLucia was named Most Outstanding Player at the 2022 College World Series after leading Mississippi to its first national championship and went in the sixth round that July, but his pro debut was delayed for two years because of Tommy John surgery. He logged a 2.55 ERA, .197 average-against and a 52/12 K/BB ratio in 49 1/3 innings, mostly in High-A. He sat at 92-94 mph and reached 97 with his fastball, backing it up with an effective low-80s slider. Royals: Brett Squires, 1B/OFMuch of the attention on the Kansas City contingent goes to top-five prospects Jac Caglianone and Carter Jensen, and rightfully so. But Squires has an interesting story as a first baseman who signed as an undrafted free agent out of Oklahoma in 2022 and has been a solid pro performer ever since. He was just named a 2024 Midwest League end-of-season All-Star, despite being limited to 62 games for High-A Quad Cities, after hitting .309/.390/.481 with nine homers and 16 steals. His .481 slugging percentage and .871 OPS each ranked third among 111 Midwest Leaguers with at least 250 plate appearances, while his 149 wRC+ placed 11th across 263 such hitters at all of High-A. Have the latest news, ticket information, and more from the Pirates and MLB delivered right to your inbox. Tigers: Rayner Castillo, RHPThe 20-year-old right-hander began his third straight season in the Rookie-level Florida Complex League but quickly pushed himself to Single-A Lakeland in late May after only three starts. He was effective in the Florida State League with a 2.52 ERA but relied more on ground balls (58.6 percent of contact) than missed bats (just a 17.3 percent K rate) in his 60⅔ innings. Castillo works with both a four-seamer and sinker in the 94-97 mph range and gets most of the whiffs he does generate with a low-80s slider and a 89-91 mph changeup, the former being much better than the latter. Twins: Ben Ross, UTILRoss did nothing but hit over three years at Notre Dame, leaving with a career .405/.471/.758 line that helped him land in the fifth round of the 2022 Draft. A former member of the Twins’ Top 30, he’s shown off some power (19 homers in 2023, 11 in 2024) and speed (20 steals this season), but has struggled making consistent contact to use his tools. The AFL could help him make some adjustments and he’s already shown he’s comfortable moving all over the field, having done everything but pitch and catch since becoming a pro. White Sox: Anthony Hoopii-Tuionetoa, RHPHoopii-Tuionetoa didn't allow a run in nine AFL regular-season appearances while helping Surprise win the 2023 championship, then went from the Rangers to the White Sox in a trade for Robbie Grossman this may. Relying mostly on a mid-90s fastball that touches 99 mph and a mid-80s slider with two-plane depth when it's on, he recorded a 4.30 ERA and a .223 average-against with a 47/17 K/BB ratio in 46 innings. More from MLB Pipeline:• Top 100 prospects | Stats | Video | Podcast | Complete coverage  AMERICAN LEAGUE WEST Angels: David Mershon, INFAs a Draft-eligible sophomore at Mississippi State this past spring, Mershon posted a healthy .347/.454/.500 line with more walks than strikeouts and 27 steals. The Angels nabbed him in the 18th round and went over the Day 3 slot to sign him for $255K. In true Angels fashion, they sent him aggressively to Double-A for his pro debut and he held his own. He’s one of two 2024 draftees currently in the AFL (first-rounder Jac Caglianone is the other). Astros: Joey Mancini, RHPA 15th-rounder out of Boston College in 2022, Mancini reached Double-A this season and ranked sixth in ERA (2.12) and 11th in average-against (.191) among Minor Leaguers with 100 or more innings. His best pitch is his low-80s slider, which he sets up with a low-90s fastball. A’s: Micah Dallas, RHPAfter three years at Texas Tech, Dallas moved to Texas A&M for his fourth season of college ball before the A’s took him in the eighth round of the 2022 Draft. His first full season did not put him on the radar (7.59 ERA, .327 BAA) but his 2024 campaign did. Pitching solely in relief, the right-hander finished with a 2.94 ERA, .228 BAA and 1.11 WHIP. He walked just 2.4 per nine and struck out better than a batter per inning, thanks to an often-effective slider. Mariners: Jason Ruffcorn, RHPOriginally drafted by the Phillies in the eighth round of the 2021 Draft as a fifth-year college player, Ruffcorn couldn’t get much traction in his first two full years of pro ball. The son of former big league hurler Scott Ruffcorn, Jason was acquired by the Mariners in March for cash considerations and finally got out of High-A ball, finishing the year with a combined 3.44 ERA, 10.0 K/9 rate, .225 BAA and five saves, using a four-seamer that can miss some bats, a cutter and a sweeper. Rangers: Marc Church, RHPChurch's athleticism and arm speed enable him to generate mid-90s fastballs with tremendous carry and mid-80s sliders with two-plane depth when he's on. Signed for an over-slot $300,000 as an 18th-rounder from an Atlanta high school in 2019, he was bothered by a strained rotator cuff for much of this year. He compiled a 3.22 ERA with 24 strikeouts in 22 1/3 Triple-A innings before making his big league debut with a scoreless inning on Sept. 28.  NATIONAL LEAGUE EAST Braves: Landon Harper, RHPAfter two years at Pearl River Community College, Harper transferred to Southern Miss and was among the Division I leaders with 12 saves in 2022. The Braves took a low-risk flier on him in the 14th round that summer and he’s continued to be an effective reliever as he’s slowly moved up the ladder. He pitched very well once he got to Double-A this year (1.41 ERA, 40/9 K/BB ratio), using a full array of pitches and the ability to throw a ton of strikes rather than having any plus offerings. Marlins: Jay Beshears, SS/3BDrafted in the sixth round out of Duke by the Padres in 2023, Beshears went to the Marlins as part of a package for Tanner Scott and Bryan Hoeing during his first full pro season. An offensive-minded utility-type with fringy-to-average tools, he slashed .238/.338/.338 while advancing from Single-A to High-A. Mets: Jonathan Pintaro, RHPPintaro opened the season with the Glacier Range Riders in the independent Pioneer League, struck out 23 in 14⅓ innings and signed with the Mets on June 3. He made 15 starts in the New York system between High-A, Double-A and Triple-A and finished with a 2.68 ERA and 75 strikeouts in 74 innings. The 26-year-old right-hander, who throws exclusively out of the stretch, features a pair of fastballs in the 93-95 mph range, an 89-91 cutter, an 82-85 mph slider with longer break and a mid-80s changeup. A solid Fall League could make him a legit option in the Majors next year, mirroring Zach Penrod’s journey from the Pioneer League to MLB in the Red Sox system. Nationals: Dustin Saenz, LHPSaenz was one of the best pitching performers in the Washington system in 2023 (3.43 ERA, 1.18 WHIP in 123⅓ innings at High-A and Double-A) but needs innings after being limited to only 42⅔ this summer. He’s a pitchability lefty with good control of a full arsenal -- a 90-92 mph fastball, low-80s slider, low-80s changeup and upper-70s curveball. The Texas A&M product is Rule 5-eligible this offseason but might need to dominate in the desert to assert his place on the 40-man roster. Phillies: Tristan Garnett, LHPSix-foot-six left-handers are always worth keeping an eye on, right? Garnett signed as a free agent at age 23 in July 2021 and he spent the bulk of his time on the mound in 2024 with Double-A Reading, missing bats (11.9 K/9) but also struggling with the strike zone for the first time (6.2 BB/9). He also missed nearly two months of the season due to injury, but he does have a fastball that now touches 95-96 mph and a changeup that is an out pitch, along with a slider.  NATIONAL LEAGUE CENTRAL Brewers: Mark Manfredi, LHPMilwaukee has two quality candidates to be future closers in Jacob Misiorowski and Craig Yoho, but don’t sleep on Manfredi. The 2023 ninth-rounder out of Dayton transitioned to more of a relief role at High-A Wisconsin in his first full season, bumped his velocity up to the point at which he was touching 97-98 mph, upped his fastball usage and struck out 95 over 76 innings. His low three-quarters arm slot helps give him a quality slider as well, though he needs to work on his control to climb the ladder. Manfredi still has enough heat to let it eat and vault him toward the Majors next season. Cardinals: Ixan Henderson, LHPAn eighth-round pick out of Fresno State last year, Henderson made a solid first impression by leading St. Louis Minor Leaguers (min. 100 IP) with a 2.34 ERA over 104 frames between Single-A and High-A. The 22-year-old left-hander works with a full five-pitch repertoire (four-seam, sinker, changeup, curveball, slider). He can throw to all quadrants of the zone with that mix, helping his effectiveness, though he didn’t quite miss as many bats at the higher level this summer (26.3 percent K rate vs. 19.5). Cubs: Vince Reilly, RHPReilly went undrafted in 2022 after three years of college at Hawaii and Grand Canyon, then signed with the Athletics and pitched just 4 2/3 innings before getting released in June 2023. Picked up by the Cubs this March, he displayed a 93-98 mph fastball and promising slider and splitter while posting a 3.88 ERA, .213 average-against and 52/16 K/BB ratio in 53 1/3 innings. Pirates: Sammy Siani, OFThe younger brother of Cardinals outfielder Michael Siani, Sammy was the Pirates’ selection at No. 37 overall in the 2019 Draft and he struggled at the plate over his first two full seasons of pro ball due mostly to an extremely steep swing path that left holes he couldn’t cover. He worked to revamp his swing and cut down his in-zone miss rate considerably, enabling him to move from High-A to Double-A this season. He finished off strongly there, leaving the Pirates a little bullish about his offensive upside while feeling very confident about his above-average outfield defense. Reds: Tyler Callihan, 2B/OFOnce a top 10 prospect in the Reds system, he struggled to make a true offensive impact with a .707 OPS in 2022 and .716 the following year, though there were some small signs of life when he was bumped up to Double-A for the first time that summer. He did hit nine homers and post a .788 OPS in 2024, mostly at Double-A, but he missed two months of the season. He’s always made decent contact, but the power hasn’t come while he’s struggled to find a true defensive home (it’s looking like second base and left field now).  NATIONAL LEAGUE WEST D-backs: Kyle Amendt, RHPPitching at High-A, Double-A and Triple-A, the 2023 ninth-rounder out of Dallas Baptist posted a 40.3 percent strikeout rate that ranked fifth among 1,852 Minor Leaguers with at least 40 innings in 2024. Amendt throws with an over-the-top delivery and can get ride on his 89-92 mph fastball, but during his time with Triple-A Reno, he went more to his upper-80s cutter and upper-70s curveball -- two pitches worth watching in Statcast games at Salt River. Dodgers: Eriq Swan, RHPA high-upside project, Swan is huge (6-foot-6, 240 pounds), can reach 101 mph with his fastball and flashes a tight mid-80s slider. He also had a 6.54 ERA in three seasons at Middle Tennessee State before the Dodgers made him a supplemental fourth-round pick in 2023, and he logged a 5.16 ERA with 29 strikeouts in 22 2/3 innings at Single-A this summer while dealing with minor arm soreness. Giants: William Kempner, RHPWhen Kempner is at his best, he can run his fastball into the upper 90s, back it up with a solid mid-80s slider and flash an effective upper-80s changeup. But the 2022 third-rounder from Gonzaga missed all of this season with foot and shoulder ailments. Padres: Brendan Durfee, CDurfee played three seasons at Division III Cal Lutheran before transferring to UC Santa Barbara for 2023-24. He was a First Team All-Big West catcher after hitting .349/.455/.566 with nine homers in 46 games for the Gauchos and went in the 14th round, signing for $150,000. He continued to hit for Single-A Lake Elsinore (.893 OPS in 20 games), but the Fall League, even as hitter-friendly as it is, will provide a bigger test coming out of the gate. Pairing Durfee with Ethan Salas in Peoria gives the Javelinas an intriguing catching group. Rockies: McCade Brown, RHPA huge 2021 season at Indiana helped Brown soar into the third round of that summer’s Draft and his premium raw stuff landed him in the Rockies’ Top 30 in 2022 and 2023. The 6-foot-6 right-hander can crank his high-spin fastball into the upper 90s and he can miss bats with sharp breaking stuff. He missed the 2023 season due to Tommy John surgery and returned with considerable rust at the lower levels this year.

LATEST NEWS • All Pirates transactions RHP Kyle Nicolas (left oblique strain)Expected return: 2025Nicolas left the Pirates’ game on Sept. 16 after pitching to one batter in the eighth inning after feeling a pain on his left side. Assistant general manager Kevan Graves described the injury as "relatively minor" during his appearance on 93.7 The Fan. (Last updated: Sept. 22) 3B Ke'Bryan Hayes (lower back inflammation)Expected return: 2025Hayes was placed on the IL on Aug. 19 due to lower back inflammation. He has rehabbed and engaged in some light baseball activities, such as playing catch, but there's not enough time for him to return to game action this season, assistant general manager Kevan Graves said on 93.7 The Fan. (Last updated: Sept. 22) C Henry Davis (left hand inflammation)Expected return: 2025Davis' stint on the injured list is retroactive to Sept. 5 and it is the second time he's been on the injured list during what has been a challenging season, hitting .144 in the Majors.
