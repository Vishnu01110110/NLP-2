About the Museum Located in Acrisure Stadium, the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is dedicated to promoting, preserving and celebrating Steelers football. The Hall of Honor Museum is home to over 50 inductees and over 10,000 square feet of Steelers history. The museum provides opportunities for fans to learn more about the franchise, view rare artifacts preserved by the team, and relive the biggest moments and people in Steelers history. A portion of the proceeds go to the Art Rooney Scholarship Fund. Interactive Exhibits The walk through each decade of the franchise is accompanied by interactive videos, music, and calls to learn more about each moment and player. The Broadcast Booth is sure to be a favorite as fans make their stamp on a historic Steelers play call. Historic Archives Collected from 90 years of Steelers football, fans can view each of the six championship rings, artifacts and game worn uniforms from some of the greatest plays in NFL history and more. Hall of Honor Perhaps the highlight of the tour is the Hall of Honor that houses the bronzed football of each of the Hall of Honor members, over 50 on display. Visitors also have the opportunity to learn about each member through touch screen kiosks that include bios, photos, and videos on the inductees. New Additions The museum will feature a new rotating exhibit highlighting the 50th anniversary of Super Bowl IX, where the team won their first world championship, and the 1974 NFL Draft that produced five future Hall of Famers. This interactive display includes a photo op with an oversized Super Bowl team photo, highlights, quotes, and stats about the '74 team and season, and to highlight the display - the Super Bowl IX Lombardi Trophy for fans' viewing pleasure. Other additions include personalized interactive features for fans and a new 'Hope Harvey' display, paying homage to the team which was the beginnings of the modern-day Steelers.

Steelers Alumni Legends | Pittsburgh Steelers - Steelers.com Steelers Legends Community Steelers Legends Community More than 1,700 players have worn the Black and Gold since the team was founded in 1933. Steelers players of the past paved the way for the Steelers of today and the future. The Legends Community was created by the NFL to celebrate, embrace, educate and connect all who have played in the League. A Legend is defined as a "person or thing that inspires." With less than 1 percent of high school football players eventually being drafted by an NFL team, Commissioner Roger Goodell defined an NFL Legend as anyone who "signed a contract and played at least one preseason game. Once a Player, Always a Legend." We celebrate our Steelers Legends. Many of them remain active in business and the community, and quite a few have made Pittsburgh their home. Once a Steeler, Always a Steeler. Visit this page to see what our Legends are doing now, as well as learn more about those who came before.

This program is finding ways to support females, drive them to the top, and keep them climbing.​ 2024 Honorees Stories Like Me Stories Like Me Helen Campbell / Co-Owner and CEO Helen Campbell (she/her) and Imogen Campbell Hendricks (she/her) - co-owners, business partners, and mom and daughter team - are thrilled to be selected as Women of Steel. Stories Like Me is an indie bookstore for children through young adults, a community hub, and a safe space where all people can find themselves represented in books. To build their business, Helen and Imogen drew on their love of stories, along with their skills as project management professionals and musicians (musicians are very detail-oriented!). Before opening their brick-and-mortar store in Greenfield in November 2022, they did small pop-ups all throughout Pittsburgh to bring diverse stories into the community. Helen, a native of England began her career in film and TV, after which she worked as a project manager, brings all her Jedi/Mary Poppins-type super powers to making sure all kids and families can see themselves in stories. Imogen, named after a character from Shakespeare, reads everything voraciously, writes, organizes, and loves trying out boutique gins! They find their joy and passion through finding stories for all of our kids and families. Fierce Knockouts Fierce Knockouts Karin Christoff / Owner Karin, a proud mother of two teenage boys and married to a fellow veteran, brings a unique journey to her business. Originally from Peru, she arrived in the U.S. with no English skills but, through much sacrifice, learned by attending night school. She served as a U.S. Army soldier and was deployed to Afghanistan. She earned her bachelor's in information technology and MBA after she was honorably discharged from active duty. Inspired by her personal experiences during the pandemic, Karin founded Fierce Knockouts to address a gap in workout apparel for women. She recognized that many women gain weight around their midsection, yet most clothes are designed for an ideal body shape. By creating beautiful, confidence-boosting workout clothes, Karin aims to make busy women feel amazing whether they're working out, running errands, or doing chores at home. Her mission is to empower and uplift women, one outfit at a time. Mele's Gifts & Party Planning Mele's Gifts & Party Planning Jarmele E. Fairclaugh / Gift Creator & Owner Founded in 2019 by Gift Creator and Owner Jarmele E. Fairclaugh, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning emerged from a deeply personal journey. What began as a heartfelt tradition of creating custom gifts for Jarmele's beloved grandmother, who resided in a nursing facility, has grown into a thriving business dedicated to celebrating life's special moments. Jarmele's mission started with simple acts of love—gift-wrapping chocolates, clothing, and shoes to bring a smile to her grandmother's face. Her grandmother, a cherished beacon of joy and strength in the family following the passing of Jarmele's mother, inspired the creation of Mele's Gifts & Party Planning. Following her grandmother's passing, Jarmele's family—her son Michael and husband Mark—encouraged her to turn her passion into a business. They established a website and business cards, and with their support, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning was born. Today, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning is proud to be part of a vibrant community of woman-owned businesses and is honored to be recognized as a Woman of Steel by the Pittsburgh Steelers and PNC Bank. We specialize in custom-created gifts and exceptional event planning, dedicated to turning your ideas into reality and making every occasion memorable. Celebrate with us, and let's bring your vision to life! The Colombian Spot The Colombian Spot Karen Perdomo / Owner Karen Perdomo, a Colombian and New Jersey native, with a background in school business administration, opened The Colombian Spot, a family business, in the former Pittsburgh Public Market in October of 2015 introducing Arepas in the city of Pittsburgh for the first time. Starting as a small business with a limited space and a limited menu, it grew into a full service restaurant in the South Side neighborhood and ever since, this has been the Latin spot for many families in a time where Latin American restaurants were non-existent in the city . Later in 2022, a second location opened in the Oakland area near Pitt campus offering take out options for students and professionals. While Empanadas and Arepas are the signature items on the menu, The Colombian Spot offers a diverse Latin American fusion menu, and catering services. Karen's leadership, strategy, organization, discipline, and vision for the business, has developed many growing opportunities, including catering services for corporate and professional baseball teams, as well as community affiliations with Latin organizations and other local neighborhood organizations.

Rooney Daniel M. Rooney Learn about the late Steelers President Dan Rooney and his special relationship with the island of Ireland About the Steelers, Ireland & the NFL's 'Global Markets Program' The 'Global Markets Program', which launched in January 2022 as the International Home Marketing Areas (IHMA), grants NFL clubs access to international markets for marketing, fan engagement and commercialization activations as part of an important, long-term strategic effort to enable clubs to build their brands globally while driving NFL fan growth beyond the US. NFL clubs can apply for rights to selected international markets by submitting proposals for the International Committee to review each Spring. Clubs are awarded rights for at least a five-year term through the program. During this period, a club has the rights to pursue activities in that international market that are consistent with what they can do in their home market. There are a number of reasons why the Steelers decided to make this initiative across the Island of Ireland a priority. The Rooney family emigrated from Ireland in the 1840s and their Irish roots have remained important to them. Current Steelers President Art Rooney II became the first member of the Rooney Family to visit Northern Ireland since the family emigrated in 1840 when he visited there in the early 1970s. Former Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney and his wife, Patricia, spent a great deal of their time giving back to Ireland and worked hard to help make it a better place, whether that be through establishing The Ireland Funds or his work as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He also drove the decision to play an NFL game in Ireland in 1997. Mrs. Patricia Rooney, whose family emigrated from County Mayo in the 1920s, was a guiding force in the establishment of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature. When the NFL created the opportunity for all teams to become active in international markets, Ireland was on the team's short list. This license will enable the Steelers to bring back some of the traditions and initiatives instituted by Dan Rooney, as well as to bring some new ones forward. The NFL's 'Global Markets Program' allows the Steelers to be active across the island of Ireland. Over the coming year, the Steelers plan to re-launch an initiative started by Dan Rooney years ago, flag football. Flag is a part of the team's overall international strategy and is easy to play for young people of all ages. The Steelers also plan to enact other events, including watch parties and other football education experiences. The team is roughly two years into its NFL's 'Global Markets Program' in Mexico, and in that time, has held several in-market draft celebrations, a kicking clinic for both professional football players as well as young people, a pair of youth flag events, a large-scale watch party in Mexico City, as well as a business summit with members of the business community. We'll look to bring similar initiatives to Ireland; and plan to be thoughtful and intentional about how they are introduced. We are at the beginning of our journey in Ireland as part of the NFL's 'Global Markets Program' and much more research and planning needs to be done in this area. However, as part of our long-term planning, we aspire to return to the island to play an NFL game. The Steelers plan is to host events and activities in Ireland that will engage fans and current and former players are a part of that strategy.

Xtra Points Steelers top Raiders, 32-13 Contributing Writer/Editor LAS VEGAS - A trip to Las Vegas was just what the doctor ordered for the Steelers to end their two-game losing streak. Najee Harris rushed for 106 yards and a touchdown, while Chris Boswell kicked four field goals as the Steelers snapped their two-game losing streak with an 32-13 victory here Sunday at Allegiant Stadium over the Raiders. Harris, who had been bottled up during the Steelers' losses to the Colts and Cowboys that dropped his yards per carry average to just 3.3 yards per attempt, went over 100 yards in his first 12 carries, breaking off a number of long runs, none bigger than his 36-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that was his first score of the season. Quarterback Justin Fields also had a big day on the ground, rushing for two touchdowns as the Steelers had 183 yards on the ground. Fields also completed 14 of 24 passes for 145 yards. "I just thought it was a collective effort, not only the bigs but the perimeter people," said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. "And obviously Naj and everyone else. But I just thought anytime you have a run output like that it's not an individual, it is a collective."

(Karl Roser / Pittsburgh Steelers) T.J. Watt forced a pair of fumbles for the Steelers (4-2), both of which were recovered by teammates, while Pittsburgh's defense limited the Raiders (2-4) to 57 yards on 19 carries. Patrick Queen had a season-high 13 tackles. "I don't know what way to state it other than I'm not surprised by it but it doesn't make it any less amazing," Tomlin said of Watt. "If you've been around him during the course of his career here, you just know that he's going to seize those moments. He's going to rise up and be what we need him to be in some form or fashion." Both teams scored on their opening possessions of the game, as the Steelers took the game's opening kickoff and drove to the Las Vegas 34 before settling for a 52-yard Boswell field goal. The Raiders, however, answered with an impressive 10-play, 70-yard drive on which quarterback Aidan O'Connell completed all four of his passes for 45 yards and Alexander Mattison had 25 yards on six carries, including a three-yard TD run to cap it off to give Las Vegas a 7-3 lead. "We just made little adjustments. Things happen. It's the NFL," said Steelers linebacker Elandon Roberts. "Those guys are pros, too. We came to the sideline and we talked about it. We went back out and we did what we needed to do. It's about adjusting on the fly. It's the NFL. You think a team is going to come out and be the same every week? It's not going to happen. We did what we needed to do, talked about it and we moved forward with it." Las Vegas, however, would go three-and-out on its next two possessions, while the Steelers continued to move the ball. They added a 49-yard Boswell field goal to cut the lead to 7-6 in the second quarter after Fields missed three-straight passes after a 15-yard run by Harris to the Las Vegas 31. The Steelers then took the lead late in the first half following a forced fumble by Watt, who punched the ball loose from running back Dylan Laub. The fumble was recovered by Keeanu Benton at the Las Vegas 30. Fields was intercepted by Divine Deablo on third down, but Adam Butler was penalized for roughing Fields on the play, and the Steelers maintained control of the ball. That would prove costly, as Fields scored on fourth down from the 3, scrambling around left end. The Steelers failed on a two-point conversion, but took a 12-7 lead to the half. The Raiders got the ball to open the second half, but were forced to punt after picking up just one first down, their third since getting six on their opening possession. Jeremiah Moon, pressed into a starting role at outside linebacker due to injuries to both Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig, broke through the Las Vegas line to block the punt, giving the Steelers possession at the 9. On third-and-goal, Fields rolled to his right and threw back across the field to Pat Freiermuth for an apparent touchdown. But he was ruled to have been across the line of scrimmage and the Steelers settled for a 37-yard Boswell field goal and a 15-7 lead. Harris then willed the Steelers into the end zone on their next possession, breaking off a 26-yard run to midfield and then scoring on a 36-yard run on which he went around left end and raced down the sideline before diving to get the ball over the goal line just before being forced out of bounds by a Raiders' defender. "When drives aren't going well, you need someone to spark it," said Harris. "I always try to be that person to spark it." Unfortunately for the Steelers, star rookie center Zach Frazier was injured during the drive when a defender fell into the back of his leg. He was replaced by Ryan McCollum. Leading 22-7 following the Harris TD, his first of the season, the Steelers defense gave up the first sustained drive it had allowed since the opening possession. But after a penalty for illegal man downfield negated a Raiders touchdown, Ameer Abdullah ran the ball on second-and-goal from the 11 to the 1. Replay showed Abdullah might have broken the plane of the goal before his knee touched down, but the Raiders hurriedly ran another play and Watt stripped Abdullah of the ball, with DeShon Elliott recovering it, turning Las Vegas away for a chance to cut the game to one score early in the fourth quarter. Following a Steelers' punt, O'Connell was intercepted by Donte Jackson, his team-best third of the season. Jackson returned the interception to the Las Vegas 7, and one play later, Fields scored on a designed run to put the Steelers ahead, 29-7. The Raiders scored on their next possession on a 9-yard TD pass from O'Connell to Kristian Wilkerson but their two-point conversion try failed and the Steelers led 29-13 with 4:54 remaining in the game. Minkah Fitzpatrick recovered an onside kick attempt by the Raiders and Boswell kicked his final field goal to make it 32-13.

==================================================

Labriola On Labriola on the win over the Raiders Steelers.com This is what it can look like. The issue is whether this formula can get them where they want to go. The Steelers snapped their two-game losing streak in decisive fashion in Sin City with a 32-13 victory over the Raiders that left them at 4-2 with a lot of room for feel-good about the way they looked doing it. On offense, they entered the game with the same starting five along the offensive line for the second game in a row – the first time all season that happened – and the running game responded with its most productive showing of 2024 with 183 yards (more than 40 yards better than the 141 vs. Denver), a 5.2 average (more than 1 full yard better than the 4.1 vs. Indianapolis, and 3 rushing touchdowns (1 more than the 2 vs. Indianapolis). With all due respect to the blocking generated by the combined efforts of those same five linemen plus tight ends Pat Freiermuth and Darnell Washington and some nice work by the guys on the perimeter, it was Najee Harris who did the heavy lifting. Actually, a better description would be that Harris did the carving. Yes, Harris finished with 106 yards, a 7.6 average, and a 36-yard touchdown, and it's also true that after coming into the game ranked fourth in the NFL in broken tackles, he added to his total yesterday. But it should be noted that included in Harris' 14 carries were gains of 13, 15, 26, and 36 yards, which are nice chunks for a 242-pound man. And whatever the Raiders defenders had after dealing with that, Justin Fields sucked the remaining life out of them. Fields finished with 59 yards on 11 carries, but once you subtract the kneel-downs in victory formation, he had 7 carries/scrambles that were big plays in securing the victory. He converted a second-and-10 with a 14-yard run; a second-and-13 with an 18-yard run. And then to cap the 6-play, 30-yard drive that followed a takeaway, Fields ran for 7 yards on first-and-10 at the Raiders 12-yard line; and for 3 and a touchdown on fourth-and-1 from the 3-yard line. NFL quarterbacks typically can be categorized as either mobile, a scrambler, or a runner. Since Fields entered the NFL in 2021 as Chicago's No. 1 pick (11th overall), only Lamar Jackson has more yards rushing, and only Jalen Hurts and Josh Allen have more rushing touchdowns. Fields is a runner. "I just thought it was a collective effort, not only the bigs but the perimeter people," said Coach Mike Tomlin about the team's running game. "And obviously Najee and everyone else. But I just thought anytime you have a run output like that it's not an individual, it is a collective. That breakout run (Harris' 36-yard touchdown), I think (Pat Freiermuth) sealed the corner and allowed him to go. When I look at it, I just felt the collective energy and effort that was necessary." The question is whether Fields can reside in even the same zip code as Jackson, Hurts, and Allen reside as passers, because navigating an upcoming schedule still to include a home-and-home vs. the Ravens, Bengals, and Browns, plus one-offs vs. Washington, Philadelphia, and Kansas City is going to require more than 14-of-24 (58.3 percent) for 145 yards, with no touchdowns, no interceptions, and a rating of 75.9. That's because sometimes the defense will have 3 takeaways – one of which was a fumble recovery at the opponent's 30-yard line, one of which was a forced fumble at the 1-yard line, and one of which was an interception and return to the opponent's 7-yard line – but most of the time it won't. And sometimes special teams will contribute a blocked punt, as it did vs. the Raiders that's recovered at the opponent's 9-yard line, but most of the time it won't. In those instances when the defense and special teams don't make those kinds of contributions, the Steelers are going to need an NFL-level passing game, and right now the word that bests describes Fields' passing is "sometimes." Sometimes he sees it and makes throws on-time and on-target, and sometimes one of those three elements is missing. By all accounts, Fields is a hard worker who's coachable and a good teammate, but can he become a guy who upgrades to seeing it and making throws on time and on target most of the time, and is it even fair to expect that to happen now. Because now is when the Steelers can send a defense onto the field that contains dynamic players on every level of the unit, plus special teams that have a punter averaging 47.6 yards per, a placekicker converting 95.2 percent, and units blocking a field goal and a punt in the last 2 games. For the first time this season, Russell Wilson was the No. 2 quarterback, and that designation wasn't bestowed on him for perfect attendance at meetings. Wilson was cleared medically to be a full participant in practice, and Coach Mike Tomlin liked what he saw. "First and foremost, my No. 1 agenda was that I wanted him to be able to display his health, his ability to not only move but protect himself. I was really comfortable with what I saw there," said Tomlin. "The rest of the equation is about knocking the rust off and gaining a rapport, a relationship with the battery of receivers and things of that nature. And I thought it was a really good week from that perspective." Eventually, Tomlin will get to the point where he has seen enough of Wilson to set in motion the original plan regarding the quarterback position. As a refresher, here's what Tomlin said about it a couple of days before the Aug. 17 preseason game vs. Buffalo: "(The depth chart at quarterback) is probably in the same place that I've described it throughout the spring and the summer. Both guys are vying for the role. Russ has pole position because of the collective body of work, the totality of the body of work that he brings into the circumstance. Both guys are new to us. We're getting an opportunity to get to know them through this process. It's been a great process. Now that Russ has full health, it's going to heat up over the next couple of weeks, and I'm excited about watching it happen." That heat was cooled significantly by a recurrence of Wilson's calf injury sustained the day players reported to training camp, and the veteran with 9 Pro Bowls and a Super Bowl win on his resume was an afterthought. But there are things about Wilson – the way he sees the field, his ability to make anticipatory throws, his infectious been-there done-that persona coupled with an inclusive mentality and an up-beat approach when it comes to his teammates – that put him in the pole position and kept him there for the duration of the offseason program. His new teammates voted him a captain. It seems like there's going to come a time to revisit all that. Soon. And it's because of "now." Now is when the Steelers have to attack an 11-game stretch within a schedule that's more challenging than any other team's over the same period. Now is when they have a defense and special teams that look capable of handling their ends of the bargain. Now is when they're starting to get back some of their walking wounded. Now is when stacking enough wins through those 11 games to get where they want to go and do what they need to do once they get there is going to require more from the offense than a running game. Finding out if Wilson has what it takes to be the difference makes too much sense. It's going to happen, because it has to happen. In the meantime, it's always fun beating the Raiders in their stadium when it has been taken over by Terrible Towels.

==================================================

10 Thoughts: After early stumble, defense shut the door Contributing Writer/Editor LAS VEGAS - The Las Vegas Raiders marched methodically down the field on their opening possession, going 70 yards on 10 plays and mixing the run and pass effectively. Quarterback Aidan O'Connell, making his first start of 2024, completed all four of his passes for 45 yards Running back Alexander Mattison had six carries for 25 yards, including a 3-yard touchdown run to cap off the drive. The Raiders never even needed to convert a third down during the possession. But after allowing six first downs to the Raiders in that opening drive, the Steelers gave up just three first downs on Las Vegas' next six possessions, taking complete control of the game. After gaining 25 yards on his first six carries, Mattison had eight yards on his next eight attempts, finishing with 33 yards on 14 carries. That put everything in the hands of O'Connell, who was making his 11th career start. When the Raiders' possessions didn't end in a punt, they did so via turnover, as T.J. Watt recorded a pair of forced fumbles, while Jeremiah Moon also blocked a punt to set up a Pittsburgh touchdown. The Raiders had 70 yards on their opening possession. They had 55 yards the next six times they had the ball. And by the time they scored again in the fourth quarter, it was to make the score 29-13, well out of reach en route to a 32-13 victory here. What happened? "Really nothing," said Steelers cornerback Donte Jackson, who recorded his third interception of the season in the fourth quarter to set up the Steelers' final touchdown. "We just made sure that we knew that was it. They had a good opening drive. They hit on some stuff. As a great defense, you can't really get down on that. It's the first drive of the game. "That kind of was the message. Keep going. We've got them where we want them. We got a sense of what they wanted to do." Once the Steelers took a look at what the Raiders were trying to do – and calmed down themselves – the game became one-sided. It was just a matter of waiting for the Steelers' offense to take control. The message to the defense came from Cam Heyward. This was not going to be a repeat performance of what happened last week against the Cowboys, when Dallas posted more than 400 yards of offense and went the length of the field to score the game-winning touchdown on fourth down late in the game. The Steelers were a banged-up unit up front. But that couldn't be an excuse. Heyward's message was a simple one. Don't try to do somebody else's job. Just do your own and good things will happen. "Just calm down. Play our game," said linebacker Patrick Queen. "Take a deep breath and everybody go out and do your job. We were all so focused in on starting fast that we all tried to make plays instead of doing our job. That was the message. Settle down, go out there and play football." It worked. While the Raiders padded their stats late in this game to finish with 275 total yards, this was a dominant defensive performance against a Las Vegas team missing two of its best offensive playmakers in wide receivers Davante Adams and Jakobi Meyers. There was still enough there offensively with exciting rookie tight end Brock Bowers and Mattison to hurt the Steelers – if they tried to do too much. So the defense stopped doing that. And the yards dried up for Las Vegas. "We got comfortable and we started playing like ourselves after that first touchdown," said safety DeShon Elliott. "We were like, 'OK, let's buckle down. Let's remember who we are.'" The defense was great, allowing just two third-down conversions on 11 attempts. And it will be bolstered next week by the return of Highsmith.

(Karl Roser / Pittsburgh Steelers) • Even when he's not getting to the quarterback, Steelers linebacker Watt still finds ways to affect the game. His two punch outs of the ball on running plays are what makes him perhaps the league's most dynamic playmaking defensive force. The two forced fumbles were the 29th and 30th of his career, the most in the NFL since he came into the league in 2017. And both were huge. The first set up a touchdown before halftime that gave the Steelers a 12-7 lead. The second came at the goal line with the Raiders threatening to get back into what was then a 22-7 game. "Shoot, both were momentum changers," said Elliott. "One was in the field. Gave our offense a chance to score. The second one, they were driving. That guy is (great). We all know that. I expect him to make those kind of plays. He does that routinely. And he does the routine plays routinely. It is what's it is." The Raiders were intent on not allowing Watt to wreck the game as a pass rusher, making sure he had extra bodies blocking him whenever possible. But his ability to set the edge on running plays and then punch the ball loose as he did on his first forced fumble is truly special. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin has witnessed all of Watt's great plays in his career. But it doesn't make them any less amazing. "(I) can't say enough about T.J. that hadn't already been said in terms of his ability to impact the game in a variety of ways," Tomlin said. "It is special. Not surprised by it, but it's still special. "I don't know what other way to state it other than I'm not surprised by it, but it doesn't make it any less amazing. If you've been around him during the course of his career here, you just know he is going to seize those moments. And I think today was just a reflection of it. It's just another chapter in his awesome story that is his career." • The Steelers had runs of 36, 26, 18 and 15 yards in this game, three of which were by Najee Harris, The 18-yard run came from quarterback Justin Fields, who also had a 14-yard scamper, as well. Those things don't happen if the other 10 guys on the field aren't blocking. According to Harris, it was something that was emphasized this week. If the Steelers wanted to break off more chunk plays in the running game, the offensive line, tight ends and wide receivers had to all be involved. That happened in this game. "I just through it was a collective effort, not only the bigs, but the perimeter people and obviously Najee and everyone else," said Tomlin. "It's a collective. When I look at it, I just thought (We had) the collective energy and effort that was necessary." Harris was excellent fighting for extra yards and bouncing to the outside on both of his longest runs, including scoring by leaping from the 5 on his 36-yard touchdown. But his most impressive run might have been the 15-yard gain right up the middle of the Las Vegas defense. He bounced off of seemingly every Raiders defender on the field on his way to those 15 yards. "I don't know what he ate last night, I don't know what he did, but he sure did bring a lot today," said Fields. "Whatever he did this week, hopefully he comes back and does the same thing next week." Per NextGen Stats, Harris produced 63 more yards than expected on his 14 carries, which led to him gaining a season-best 106 yards, • The Raiders didn't help their cause by consistently overrunning the pocket, especially early in this game, allowing Fields to easily escape the pocket after defenders had been pushed by him. It was as if they've never played a mobile quarterback before. "I think it's kind of crazy," said guard Mason McCormick of that. "Justin is so mobile with his legs and he's such a threat, he did a good job of scrambling out of that pocket." This was Fields' best day as a runner in a Steelers' uniform, as he had 59 yards on 11 rushing attempts – including a taking a knee twice to end the game. • Kudos to special teams coordinator Danny Smith. He did it again, dialing up a blocked punt one week after the Steelers blocked a field goal against the Cowboys. This time it wasn't special teams ace Miles Killebrew doing the honors. Instead, it was backup outside linebacker Jeremiah Moon, who was forced into a starting role opposite Watt because of injuries to Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig. "When you make plays on special teams, that changes the whole momentum of the game. Statistically, it shoots your win rate up," said Roberts. "Me, I appreciate special teams because I know it takes all three phases of the game to win a game. Special teams, with their splash play today are the things you don't see on a stat line that you don't see from our special teams, its always hats off to them." That block came with the Steelers leading 12-7 coming out of the half and set up a Chris Boswell field goal that pushed the score to 15-7. • Patrick Queen finished this game with 13 tackles, his most since joining the Steelers. At times, it seemed like there were two of him on the field. The Steelers also didn't have any big communication breakdowns that had hurt them at times this season. Queen still wants it to be better. "It was better but it's still not where it needs to be," Queen said. "That's something we'll continue to get better at and hone in on. There's a few plays here or there where we still messed up on." • If Jackson didn't get the interception in the fourth quarter on an overthrow by O'Connell on a pass intended for Bowers, nobody was going to get that one. Jackson had Bowers covered over the top, while Minkah Fitzpatrick had him locked up underneath. The fact that Fitzpatrick had Bowers walled off underneath might have forced O'Connell to air-mail the pass. "We did a good job of communicating today, keeping everything in front of us, trusting what we see," said Jackson. "That's the kind of ball that happens when we're on our Ps and Qs, playing together." The Steelers were intent not to allow Bowers to create a lot of run after the catch, something he had excelled at this season. He finished with nine receptions, but for just 71 yards. "He's amazing in the open field, so that was definitely one of the playing notes," Jackson said. "If he catches it in front of you, make sure you make that tackle. The guys did a great job of swarming to the ball and playing all 11." • Fields didn't have his best day throwing the football, completing 14 of 24 passes for 145 yards. On one sequence early in the second quarter, he missed a wide open George Pickens, then tight end Pat Freiermuth and then Pickens again, all on overthrows. It was just one of those sequences where everything he threw was high. But he does have the right mentality about such things. "Everybody has mis-throws, nobody is perfect," Fields said. "Don't let it get in my head or anything. I missed so many throws in my career. It's nothing new. It's not anything different. Like I said everybody, mis-throws, whether you're Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, whoever." At the same time, the Steelers scored points on seven of 10 drives in this game that did not include taking a knee to end the game. Some of those were on short fields set up by the defense and special teams. But any time you score points on 70 percent of your possessions, you'll take it. • Another game, another offensive line injury. This time it was talented rookie center Zach Frazier who went down with an ankle injury when a Raiders defender rolled up the back of his leg on a play. It remains to be seen how long Frazier might be out, but his loss is just the latest in a long line of injury issues the Steelers have had up front this season. Frazier, a second-round draft pick, has been perhaps the best rookie offensive lineman in the league this season. "I love Zach. I feel bad for him," said fellow rookie McCormick, who has started games at both left and right guard because of injuries to Isaac Seumalo and James Daniels. "I don't know exactly what it is. I know he's tough and he'll bounce back." The Steelers could get offensive tackle Dylan Cook back at practice this week. He's been on injured reserve since the start of the season with an ankle injury. But Daniels is done for the season, as is Nate Herbig. There is a chance first-round draft pick Troy Fautanu could return at some point later in the season. • Dale Lolley is co-host of "SNR Drive" on Steelers Nation Radio. Subscribe to the podcast here: Apple Podcast | iHeart Podcast But the offensive line injuries have been rough. Sunday's game marked the first time this season the Steelers have started the same offensive line group in back-to-back games. And they've used four different starting lineups in their first six games. Assuming Frazier can't go next week against the Jets, they will make that five different starting groups. Ryan McCollum replaced Frazier against the Raiders. "Ryan is extremely trustworthy," said McCormick. "He knows what's going on. We trust Ryan. Obviously, we're going to miss Zach. Ryan will step in and do great." • At 4-2, the Steelers have put themselves in a good spot through six weeks, especially since four of those games have been on the road, where the Steelers are 3-1 this season. Now, they get back-to-back home games in the next two weeks against the two New York teams. The crowd at Acrisure Stadium has its work cut out for it the next two weeks after what the one did Sunday here at Allegiant Stadium. Steelers fans took this place over like they have no other venue in recent years. "It was just an exciting atmosphere," said Jackson. "It was amazing.

From the Press Room: Steelers at Raiders Steelers.com Getting back to business: The Steelers turned things around against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday, coming up with a 32-13 win after dropping two straight games. And while the game was on the road, it had the atmosphere of being at home, with Steelers fans turning out in large numbers and having an impact on the game. "The first thing that needs to be said is I'm just really taken aback by the support that we got here from our fans, Steelers Nation," said Tomlin. "Continually they show up and I just thought it was awesome. The environment for a road venue was special. It was special to be a part of it." The Raiders came out of the gate strong, scoring on their opening drive when they marched the ball down the field on a 10-play, 70-yard drive that finished with a three-yard touchdown run by Alexander Mattison. The defense tightened the reins after the opening drive, forcing three turnovers, including two forced fumbles by linebacker T.J. Watt and an interception by Donte Jackson. "Can't say enough about T.J. that hadn't already been said in terms of his ability to impact the game in a variety of ways," said Tomlin. "It is special. We're not surprised by it. But it's still special. "I don't know what other way to state it other than I'm not surprised by it, but it doesn't make it any less amazing. If you've been around him during the course of his career here, you just know that he is going to seize those moments. He's going to rise up and be what we need him to be in some form or fashion. And I just think today was a reflection of it. It's just another chapter in his awesome story that is his career." Running back Najee Harris got it done on the ground, with 14 carries for 106 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown run, the longest offensive play of the day for the Steelers. It was Harris' first 100-yard game of the season. "I felt like we needed to get another win. We lost two in a row. It was the perfect time to get another win. We are 4-2, going to play our next opponent. That is really just my mindset." Overall the ground game put up 183 yards, something Tomlin said was a group effort. "I just thought it was a collective effort, not only the bigs, but the perimeter people and obviously Najee and everyone else," said Tomlin. "It is a collective. When I look at it, I just thought the collective energy and effort that was necessary." The win improved the Steelers record to 4-2, with a Sunday night game against the New York Jets next up. "Just really appreciative of getting back on track and handling our business and winning, because that's what this business is about," said Tomlin. "Winning is our business. Football is our game. Winning is our business. We hadn't been handling business. And so, it was just good to get back to taking care of business. This is a normal state for us. It needs to be." On the injury front, center Zach Frazier left the game with an ankle injury and didn't return. "It'll be evaluated," said Tomlin. "There were some other guys that went out of the game but were able to return. Minkah (Fitzpatrick) was able to go back with his shoulder. Donte Jackson was able to go back with his shoulder, to name a few. "We'll keep assessing those things. I'll give you an update next time we come together on some of the medical things." Affecting the game: Linebacker T.J. Watt knew the assignment on Sunday. Just play his game. With injuries to outside linebackers Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig, stopping Watt was the focus for the Raiders offense. "I can definitely feel the slides and more chips and things of that nature," said Watt of the attention the Raiders paid to him. "But I understand that at a certain point, if they want to truly eliminate you getting to the quarterback with getting the ball out quickly, the slides, the chips, a team can pretty much do that if they want to," said Watt. "So, I'm going to have to try to find ways to continue to affect the game as much as possible." And he did just that. Watt finished the game with five solo tackles, two tackles for a loss and two forced fumbles that he used the textbook punch out to create. "I've been doing the punch out since college, I carried that with me from Wisconsin," said Watt. "It's been something I've continued to try to do, especially when you get in those situations. When you have a defense that flies around like this, you're able to take more chances. I don't always get the football, but when you do, it's a big play." With Highsmith and Herbig out, it was Jeremiah Moon and Ade Ogundeji, who was signed to the 53-man roster from the practice squad on Saturday, who were asked to step up. "I just thought it was an awesome game in that we had a lot of guys getting elevated and getting an opportunity to contribute who hadn't," said Coach Mike Tomlin. "And I'm just really thankful for their efforts. Just the collective attention to detail that allows that to happen. "When you have guys that have been elevated, that lack in-game experience and stuff like that, usually it's a collective in terms of communication and so forth to make sure the day comes off with fluidity." Both Moon and Ogundeji made their contributions, with Moon even coming up with a blocked punt. "He played a lot," said Watt of Moon. "Him and Ade stepped up, had a great game today, trying to find ways to get off the field a little bit more and let those guys get some snaps. We knew they were more than capable of getting some positive snaps. And even at the end, Ade had a couple of nice rushes. And the blocked punt was incredible by Moon." On the run: Quarterback Justin Fields completed 14 of 24 passes for 145 yards. And while he didn't get it in the endzone in the air, he rushed 11 times for 59 yards and two touchdowns, including a three-yard run and a seven-yard run in the fourth quarter to seal the game. "I thought he did a nice job, particularly making some things happen with his legs, managing the circumstances and taking care of the ball," said Coach Mike Tomlin. "Obviously, he took a few hits, but he's a tough guy. I'm glad he's okay and we'll keep moving." It was the run game that got their share of attention on Sunday, and their share of praise. And rightfully so. Najee Harris put up 106 yards rushing, and the offense as a whole had 183 yards rushing. "The O-line did a great job," said Fields. "Najee did a great job. All the running backs did a great job to be honest with you. I think we played with a lot of effort and physicality. Yards after contact. Najee was getting pushed by the O-line a couple of times. Those yards after contact, pushing the pile. We need those kinds of sparks. "I don't know what (Najee) ate last night. I don't know what he did, but he sure did ball out today. So, whatever he did this week, hopefully he comes back and does the same thing next week." Fields said what Harris was able to do in the run game helped the offense overall, especially on Fields' second touchdown run. "I think my second rushing touchdown, Najee scored on the toss so they were probably thinking we were going to do the same thing," said Fields. "There were only one or two guys over there. It starts with the O-line up front and the run game. Everything works off of that. Najee and the O-line did a great job executing." It wasn't just the offense that benefitted from Harris and the ground game. The defense did as well. "It's huge anytime you are able to run the ball in the National Football League," said linebacker T.J. Watt. "It's demoralizing for a defense. We know from experience. But it also allows us to get a little bit more wind on the sideline and be able to come out. And we always say the best defenses spend a lot of time on the bench."

October's Rocks glass: Super Steelers - 1974 World Champions OUR ROSTER VODKA & RUM VODKA & RUM Few things can live up to the legacy of the 1974 World Championship Steelers or the best defensive line in the history of the game. But we can forever immortalize both with the introduction of Boyd & Blair Steel Curtain Vodka and Boyd & Blair Steel Curtain Rum. The distillery of our hometown hero Boyd & Blair is a mere seven miles north of Acrisure Stadium and is run by lifelong Steeler fans and native Pittsburghers, Barry and Jen Young (Duquesne and Pitt alums, respectively) using only the finest Pennsylvania potatoes and locally-sourced molasses. Both the vodka and rum are award winners many times over, but the Potato Vodka made history by being named #1 Vodka by the "Ultimate Spirits Challenge" three times, beating out every other vodka brand globally!

Originally from Peru, she arrived in the U.S. with no English skills but, through much sacrifice, learned by attending night school. She served as a U.S. Army soldier and was deployed to Afghanistan. She earned her bachelor's in information technology and MBA after she was honorably discharged from active duty. Inspired by her personal experiences during the pandemic, Karin founded Fierce Knockouts to address a gap in workout apparel for women.

Her mission is to empower and uplift women, one outfit at a time. Mele's Gifts & Party Planning Mele's Gifts & Party Planning Jarmele E. Fairclaugh / Gift Creator & Owner Founded in 2019 by Gift Creator and Owner Jarmele E. Fairclaugh, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning emerged from a deeply personal journey. What began as a heartfelt tradition of creating custom gifts for Jarmele's beloved grandmother, who resided in a nursing facility, has grown into a thriving business dedicated to celebrating life's special moments. Jarmele's mission started with simple acts of love—gift-wrapping chocolates, clothing, and shoes to bring a smile to her grandmother's face. Her grandmother, a cherished beacon of joy and strength in the family following the passing of Jarmele's mother, inspired the creation of Mele's Gifts & Party Planning. Following her grandmother's passing, Jarmele's family—her son Michael and husband Mark—encouraged her to turn her passion into a business. They established a website and business cards, and with their support, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning was born. Today, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning is proud to be part of a vibrant community of woman-owned businesses and is honored to be recognized as a Woman of Steel by the Pittsburgh Steelers and PNC Bank. We specialize in custom-created gifts and exceptional event planning, dedicated to turning your ideas into reality and making every occasion memorable.

Later in 2022, a second location opened in the Oakland area near Pitt campus offering take out options for students and professionals. While Empanadas and Arepas are the signature items on the menu, The Colombian Spot offers a diverse Latin American fusion menu, and catering services.

Antes del juego: Semana 6- Steelers @ Raiders Los Pittsburgh Steelers visitarán Las Vegas para enfrentarse a los Raiders el próximo domingo a las 2:05 p.m. hora del centro de México. Los Steelers vienen de su segunda derrota consecutiva tras un inicio 3-0 de la temporada y buscan regresar al camino de la victoria. La buena noticia es que los Steelers tienen marca 4-0 contra la División Oeste de la AFC desde 2022 (2-0 vs LV y 1-0 vs DEN y LAC). El último partido entre Pittsburgh y Las Vegas fue el SNF de la semana tres de la temporada pasada en la que los QBs que se enfrentaron fue Kenny Pickett contra Jimmy Garoppolo, mucho ha cambiado en ambas franquicias desde entonces. Mike Tomlin habló ante los medios de comunicación como todos los martes y mencionó una actualización importante respecto a Russell Wilson y es que este miércoles fue el primer entrenamiento con completa participación de Wilson con el equipo y aunque Justin Fields tomó las repeticiones con el primer equipo la posibilidad de ver a Rusell Wilson está "entreabierta" en palabras de Coach T y todo dependerá de su desarrollo y desempeño durante el resto de la semana. Será interesante ver la situación del quarterback de nuestros rivales. Gardner Minshew fue banqueado durante el partido de la semana 5 y su lugar fue tomado por Aiden O'Connell y aunque para el momento de esta nota no hay un titular definido para el próximo domingo lo que tenemos muy claro desde nuestra trinchera será la presión que podamos ejercer ante cualquiera de sus opciones. T.J. Watt viene de haber registrado su sack número 100 en la NFL y será exigido al doble ya que ni Alex Highsmith ni Nick Herbig verán acción en Las Vegas. Como todas las semanas será clave establecer el juego terrestre temprano en el partido. Warren todavía es duda para participar en el partido y Patterson no podrá jugar por una lesión en el tobillo. Najee Harris y Justin Fields serán los encargados de llevar la carga terrestre; cabe señalar que la defensiva de los Raiders han permitido 4.9 yardas en promedio por acarreo, así que habrá que tomar ventaja de esa debilidad el próximo domingo. Ojito con lo que haga Brock Bowers, el ala cerrada novato de los Raiders, quién es líder del equipo con 28 recepciones, 313 yardas y un touchdown. Será un partido duro, especialmente con todas las bajas por lesión que tiene el equipo pero nada está escrito. El partido lo podrán disfrutar a través de la señal de Fox Sports en México, por steelers.com con Álvaro Martín y Arturo Carlos y por NFL Game Pass Internacional. Qué sea un gran domingo para los Steelers y regresemos al camino de las victorias. Here we go!

==================================================

Los Steelers pierden en casa ante los Cowboys en dramático final Los Pittsburgh Steelers cayeron 20-17 contra los Dallas Cowboys en el partido correspondiente a la semana 5 de la temporada regular de la NFL. Fue un partido parejo en el que se cometieron muchos errores por ambos equipos y que se decidió en un dramático final con menos de un minuto en el reloj de juego. La historia no fue muy diferente con lo que hemos visto que falta por mejorar del equipo en estas primeras cinco semanas, la ofensiva sigue teniendo un arranque muy lento en la primera mitad del partido y no logra establecer el dominio o ventaja deseada por falta de efectividad en terceras oportunidades, errores básicos en la ejecución o pañuelos por faltas de concentración y disciplina. "No hay nada místico con el resultado, creo que no hicimos lo suficiente durante 60 minutos para salir victoriosos, específicamente creo que arrancamos lento con la ofensiva y nos hicimos heridas autoinflingidas, castigos y falta de concentración" fueron las palabras de Mike Tomlin después del partido. La ofensiva es un punto a mejorar y Coach Tomlin y los jugadores lo tienen muy claro. La defensiva dio un buen partido, provocó tres entregas de balón forzadas con dos intercepciones y un sack fumble de T.J. Watt, misma captura que significó la número 100 en la carrera del linebacker de los Steelers. A post shared by Steelers En Español (@lossteelers) Nick Herbig quien estaba teniendo un gran partido y había suplido de manera extraordinaria la ausencia por lesión de Alex Highsmith, no pudo terminar el juego debido a una lesión en el muslo. Los equipos especiales también se lucieron con un gol de campo bloqueado y Boswell certero en el único intento de gol de campo que tuvo y en sus dos puntos extra. En la segunda mitad vimos un partido completamente diferente por parte de ambos equipos, Justin Fields lanzó para dos pases de anotación, uno a Connor Heyward y otro para Pat Freiermuth que ponía la ventaja 17 -13 a favor de los Steelers con poco menos de cinco minutos de juego en el reloj. "Tenemos que ser mucho mejores y no dispararnos nosotros mismos en el pie, tenemos que aprovechar los balones que recupera nuestra defensiva para tener mejor control en los partidos", fueron las palabras de Justin Fields ante los medios de comunicación. La defensiva tomó el campo pero los Cowboys lograron avanzar el balón hasta la yarda cuatro de los Steelers, quienes defendieron de manera increíble durante tres oportunidades, de hecho Elandon Roberts provocó un balón suelto en la yarda uno que casi recuperamos con lo que se hubiera terminado el partido de haberlo recuperado. En cuarta oportunidad Dak Prescott conectó Tolbert y sentenció el encuentro. Mucho que mejorar para las siguientes semana, los Steelers viajan a Las Vegas para enfrentarse a los Raiders y en la semana hablaremos más sobre este partido. Gracias a toda la afición mexicana que fue a apoyarnos hasta Pittsburgh, saben que es su casa. A post shared by Steelers En Español (@lossteelers) Here we go!

You can view more of Brian's work online at www.briandumm.com Week 3: Steelers vs. Chargers Week 3: Steelers vs. Chargers Bio: Hi, my name is Matt Spahr. I'm one of the local artists selected to design one of this year's Steelers home game posters. I grew up during one of the most exciting era of Steelers football, the 1970's and early 80's. Along with being a huge Pittsburgh sports fan, I was also very much into comic books and skateboarding. From an artistic perspective, I've always been the kind of guy who'd rather read a copy of Vaughn Bodé's Cheech Wizard than stand in a museum, staring at paintings that, more times than not, mean nothing to me. Over the years, not much has changed in that regard. I still love comics, skateboarding, graffiti, rock music and smash mouth Steelers football. Some of the fine folks that I've had the pleasure of working with are: Condado tacos (Team Lead, 12 locations, from here to Huntsville, AL), Millie's Ice Cream, Richard DeShantz Restaurant Group and Pyrotecnico Fireworks, just to name a few. I also work as a freelance illustrator when I'm not up in a scissor lift painting murals. I'd like to mention that working on this project has been a blast, and it's my hope that fans like the poster as much as I liked making it. 2024 Season Poster 2024 Season Poster Bio: Nina Zivkovic is the Design Director of Ready®, one of the fast-growing sports nutrition brands in America. She has had the pleasure of working with the Pittsburgh Steelers & Commonwealth Press for three years on their incredible Game Day Poster Series.

Community Corner: Giving kids hope Steelers.com 2024 Season Thursday, October 10 Giving kids hope: Steelers General Manager Omar Khan took part in a Hispanic Heritage Month program at Arsenal Middle School on Thursday morning, along with Roberto Clemente Jr., the son of late Pittsburgh Pirates great Roberto Clemente. Khan spoke to students, many who are immigrants, some who recently arrived in the United States and are looking for guidance as they are on a path that is new to them, with many just starting to learn the English language. Pittsburgh Arsenal 6-9 is an English as a second language regional center that provides support for students who are new to the English language while providing access to the mainstream curriculum. "The main thing that I emphasized is the importance of having big dreams and chasing their dreams, so they have something to look forward to in the future," said Khan. "I also told them life doesn't get easier. Every day, it gets harder. "One of the things that's always been important for me is I had great people around me to help support me through the years. "I emphasized how important it was for all of them in that room, even if they come from different backgrounds, different experiences, how they got here. They need to stick together, and they need to look out for each other because if they do it together, they're going to get through these hard times right now with each other, united." Both Khan and Clemente spoke to the students in Spanish, putting everyone in a comfortable setting where all could understand the message and take part on the conversation, which included a Q&A session with the them. The visit was done in conjunction with CHAMP, which provides an integrated mentorship and well-being for a community of underrepresented minority (URM) medical and middle school students. The mentorship provides a bridge program between UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Graduate Medical Education and its Office of Diversity, local mentorship program, community organizations, and local government agencies for URM medical students in Pittsburgh and Arsenal Middle School. "I saw some of the kids look up at me when I told them I have two immigrant parents," said Khan. "For them, that was a wow, he does moment. I talked about how important it was for me to never forget some of the things that I've witnessed growing up and things I experienced. "What Children's Hospital does with this program is just phenomenal because it gives those kids some insight into the real world. The world most of those kids have grown up seeing is not the same one that they're going to face here in the United States. This is so important. I can't give enough credit to them for what they're doing." Khan's mother was born in Honduras and his father in India, and while they met in the United States, Khan understands the struggles those who immigrate to this country face. "Any opportunity I have to help a young person with their future, I'm always going to do whatever I can do because I always appreciated it when people did that for me," said Khan. "If you go back 30 years and the people I was around then, a majority of the people probably would never have expected that I'd be sitting where I'm sitting right now. Any time I can help those kids, I'm going to do whatever I can. "I just want to give them hope. What I noticed today with some of those kids, they're searching for hope. They haven't found hope because of where they are from, how they got here and some of the stuff that they've faced in their lives. They're searching for hope. "If I can give at least one of those kids just a little bit of hope, I'm going to do everything I can." Tuesday, October 1 Reaching out to area youth: Steelers players were out and about in the community today, using their off day to give back in numerous manners. Calvin Austin III and Thomas Graham Jr. spent time at Caf√© Momentum, where they met with Liz Ryan, the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention for the United States. Caf√© Momentum Pittsburgh is a place where Pittsburghers can go and enjoy fine dining. It also offers a culinary internship to teens 15 to 19 who are justice-involved. Caf√© Momentum, which originated in Dallas, provides a transformative experience through a 12-month paid post-release internship program. Participants rotate through the restaurant, focusing on life and social skills, coaching and development. Throughout the month of October, the Steelers will be working with organizations around the city as a part of Youth Justice Action Month (YJAM) to raise awareness about the impact of the justice system on children and the organizations that are working to make a positive impact in the community. Youth Justice Action Month (YJAM) is an annual campaign where advocates come together to organize digital and in-person events and activities to raise awareness and inspire action on behalf of young people impacted by the justice system. This year is also the 50th Anniversary of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Action, which is a United States federal law providing formula grants to states that follow a series of federal protections on the care and treatment of youth in the juvenile justice and criminal justice systems. Cooking for a cause: As a part of breast cancer awareness month, and in conjunction with the NFL's Crucial Catch initiative, Steelers players took part in the annual Healthy Cooking Demo with UPMC. Isaiahh Loudermilk and DeShon Elliott led the cooking demo at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital, making it a fun and meaningful afternoon for breast cancer patients and survivors. The players prepared healthy food options, giving a variety of tasty, yet healthy treats. "Nutrition to me is important," said Elliott. "It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle. I prefer to eat healthy." For Loudermilk, being part of the cooking class is personal as his mother, Stacy Howell, is a breast cancer survivor. "It means a lot to me," said Loudermilk of taking part in the cooking class. "I'm personally affected by it, growing up with my mom having breast cancer. Being able to come out here now and educate myself on making these healthy meals, and putting smiles on faces is always a great time. It means a lot to me to be here." Loudermilk said he is simple when it comes to his cooking style, while Elliott has worked on perfecting his cooking skills. What they both have perfected, though, is giving back to the community. "As much as God has blessed me, I do my due diligence to give back to the community," said Elliott. "Why not bring happiness and joy to them." Tuesday, September 24 School days: Linebacker T.J. Watt and his wife Dani were busy on Tuesday, visiting multiple schools in the Pittsburgh area as part of the Steelers back to school blitz. Watt began his day at Pittsburgh King, where he read to the students and then handed out supply bags to help the kids in the school year. "It's fun. It really is," said Watt. "To see the excitement, to feel the excitement, I haven't been around a bunch of screaming kids at 9:30 in the morning ever. "It's fun to be able to do it with Dani. Having a little one on the way, it puts things more into perspective about people who are less fortunate and don't have the school supplies or the toiletries to be able to go to school and not have to worry about those things, and that's what we're trying to provide. "It's such a busy time of year, but it's so important on these Tuesdays, our off days, that we take the time to get out in the community and show people that we're not just on television and we are separated. I want to bridge that gap and show people that we care, and we want to help them as much as possible." It was then off to Pittsburgh Milliones where he took questions from the kids and again handed out supply bags. "That was funny. They asked my favorite class, and I don't have a favorite class if I am being honest with anyone," said Watt. "The questions, it's always surreal when kids are nervous to ask questions. I have to remember, to them I am some big guy. But I am such a normal goofball that I forget that sometimes. The kids had great questions, and it was fun to be able to answer some of them." Watt did the event in conjunction with The Education Partnership, who work to provide school supplies to students and teachers in under-resourced schools across Southwestern Pennsylvania. The agency has served more than 374,770 students in 201 schools and given out more than $65,000,000 worth of school resources. Golf for a cause: Pat Freiermuth, Jalen Elliott and Rodney Williams took part in the annual Tee Up Fore Bundle-Up Mini Golf Classic at Puttshack Pittsburgh. The fun event included a competitive nine-hold round of miniature golf, dinner and prizes all benefitting Project Bundle-Up. The Salvation Army's Project Bundle-Up is a program started by two late Pittsburgh staples, Patricia Rooney, the wife of late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, and Joe DeNardo, the former WTAE-TV weatherman. The program is focused on providing winter outwear for kids and others in need in the Pittsburgh area and focusing on taking them shopping to pick out their own items. We had a great time at Langley K-8 at our Steelers Phys Ed Class!Special thanks to Rodney Williams, for joining us today üôå@GiantEagle pic.twitter.com/GzGltlzGI2 Friday, September 20 A wish comes true: Friday was a special day for Bryant Sanchez, a 19-year-old from Orange County, Ca., who was the guest of the Steelers and the Make-A-Wish Foundation at the team's practice at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex. Sanchez, who has leukemia, got to enjoy watching practice up close and personal, as well as meet some of his favorite players following practice, which included getting plenty of pictures and autographs. "This is really exciting," said Sanchez. "Just because I am here with my family, this is my first time seeing the Steelers here at a home game. I have never been to a game before. This is exciting." Sanchez will also attend the Steelers game this week against the Chargers at Acrisure Stadium as a guest of the team. "At first I wanted my wish to just be a jersey," said Sanchez. "I felt like I would end up getting too sick coming here. But being here is just different. "I never really knew about football until a friend of mine told me to join football with him. My cousin was a Steelers fan, so I went with them. "I am pretty stoked to go to the game. My family and I, we never really do anything like this so it's awesome."

The rookies toured the facility, which now includes The Market, an onsite pantry where recipients can select their own items and there is no judgement, and all are treated with dignity and respect. The items are all available at no cost and include fresh produce, meats, shelf-stable foods and more. The players also took part in packing produce for distribution, giving them a unique understanding of what is needed to help those who are struggling with food insecurity. Taking care of kids: Tight end Pat Freiermuth has always been passionate about giving back to the Pittsburgh community, loving the ability to interact with others, especially with kids while bringing them joy. That is why he was out and about on his off day, providing school supplies to students at Pittsburgh Mifflin to aid them in the school year. Freiermuth worked hand-in-hand with The Education Partnership, who work to provide school supplies to students and teachers in under-resourced schools across Southwestern Pennsylvania. The agency has served more than 374,770 students in 201 schools and given out more than $65,000,000 worth of school resources. Today, our newest friends to the ‚ÄòBurgh, @DangeRussWilson and @ciara stopped by to visit.

The team worked with local branches of the military, including the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. "We're really excited to take part in events like this in the community and also bring the different branches together," said Master Sgt. Starsha Jyachosky of the U.S. Army. "It's nice to be thought of like this. It makes us feel like we are part of the community to be asked to come out to an event like this. We are having some fun banter back and forth and it's awesome. "There is a smile on everybody's face. It's so much fun to take part in this. "It means the world to service members to do this. It's something a lot of them don't get to do. To be invited down here and interact with the players is a once in a lifetime opportunity for a lot of them." The event traditionally has been held in the days leading up to or after the anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and as part of that there was a somber moment of silence to honor all of the lives that were lost on the horrific day. While those who were lost were still on their minds, the members of the military were able to relax as well and enjoy a night that was focused solely on them. Three football stations, including passing, receiving and field goal kicking, were set up around the field, a perfect opportunity for the military members to test their skill level with those who do it for a living. Among the players taking part were Keeanu Benton, Jalen Elliott, Thomas Graham Jr., Christian Kuntz and Isaiahh Loudermilk. In addition to the drills, the players posted for pictures with the military members as they shared stories of watching football while on deployment. "It's important because they give of their time to do well by us," said Benton. "I feel like by any means, if I can do the same, I will do it. being out here giving back. "It's about the interaction for me. Not that I can't teach them skills, but the interaction part is something they don't get to do every day with NFL players. "This just goes to show the culture we have here with the Steelers, making ourselves available to do things like this."

(Alysa Rubin / Pittsburgh Steelers) Tuesday, September 3 Back to school blitz continues: Defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi continued the spirit of helping kids heading back to the classroom when he hosted his third annual Back To School event. Ogunjobi provided backpacks and school supplies to 300 kids at Urban Academy in Pittsburgh. "I love having the opportunity to give every single year and to be an integral part of the start of the school year," said Ogunjobi. "Great school supplies are the foundation of a successful school year, it's always good to come back and see familiar faces, I can't wait to see what the future holds for this group of bright students." Ogunjobi has worked with Urban Academy the past three years, a school known for their S.T.E.M. program, something that hits home for him as he earned his degree in computer science and biology from North Carolina Charlotte. "The Urban Academy community thanks Larry and the Pittsburgh Steelers for their ongoing commitment to our students and community," said Chase Patterson, CEO of Urban Academy. "For the third consecutive year, Larry's generosity is making a difference in supporting our student's success. Larry and the Steelers organization continue to demonstrate their overarching dedication to uplifting and investing in young people's futures. On behalf of the entire Urban Academy family, thank you for your unwavering support and partnership." Thursday, August 22 Back to school ready: Safety DeShon Elliott has already immersed himself in the Pittsburgh community, hosting a back-to-school event for area students on Thursday evening. "The kids are our pillars. Growing up, football was important to me, but my parents also preached education," said Elliott. "I am not just doing back to school supplies, but clothes and shoes too. It's hard for parents, especially single parent homes, and I have two sisters who are single mothers, and it can be hard to try and provide everything you need for school. That takes a burden off the kids and the moms. The kids can then just focus on their education. "And this is an opportunity for me to give back to my hometown, which is now here." Elliott took a group of kids shopping for their back-to-school needs as well as shoes and clothes, making sure they are set for the new school year. He also spent time interacting with the kids, being present, which is sometimes one of the most important aspects. "It means a lot," said Elliott. "I am giving back, but being there, showing up, that means a lot to kids. Being able to talk to them, and them learning from me, who I am, answering questions. Talking to kids about football, other things. I just want to be hands on and really get to know them." Monday, August 19 Making back to school cool: Linebacker Alex Highsmith hosted his 3rd Annual Back to School Bash for 300 area students at the LaRosa Youth Club in McKeesport. Highsmith handed out backpacks, books and school supplies to the students through the Alex Highsmith Family Foundation. In addition, the foundation provided free haircuts, water bottles, and to-go meals to provide the kids a nutritious option as the school year is set to begin. "We are incredibly excited to host this event once again and to continue our mission of giving back to the community," said Highsmith. "Providing these resources helps ensure that every child has the tools they need to succeed academically and start the school year with confidence." Back to school in style: The new school year is about to get underway for many kids in the area, and the importance of sending kids back to the classroom with all the necessities is definitely a priority. That is why the Steelers joined forces with others to be a part of the 12th Annual Pittsburgh Public Schools Back to School Event at Acrisure Stadium. This year, Cameron Heyward's foundation, The Heyward House, and Russell Wilson's Why Not You Foundation, are working hand-in-hand with the team and the Mentoring Partnership to provide support for kids and families, with the theme, 'Students first‚Ä¶Always, in all ways.' To give the kids a fresh start for school, the Steelers provided haircuts, hairstyles and manicures, giving everyone a self-esteem boost. Working with The Heyward House and Why Not You Foundation, they also provided hygiene kits and books. In addition, they connected the students with much needed resources that will benefit them throughout their educational endeavors. Students were able to attend the event in person and take advantage of all of the activities, or participate in the drive-thru version where they were able to still get free school supplies and other essentials without having to leave their car. The event was also something the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation were a part of.

Today, @FosterLovePgh & @SOPennsylvania joined us for our last practice of #SteelersCamp this week! pic.twitter.com/eVK7gTXlyA Saturday, July 27 A wish comes true: Saturday was a dream come true for 18-year-old Cole Walker, who was a guest of the Steelers at training camp through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Walker, who is a huge Steelers fan, met several Steelers players after practice, including George Pickens who helped in the presentation of granting his wish for Steelers season tickets through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. "This was such an honor," said Walker. "I am truly grateful to the Steelers and Make-A-Wish for this opportunity. It's awesome. "I am so excited. I have always loved the Steelers, always loved going to games and supporting the team. This is an amazing opportunity. I am so happy and excited." Walker, who is from Pittsburgh, is dealing with sarcoma and his wish was all about enjoying his favorite team all year. And at camp, all his wishes came true. "It was just so exciting," said Walker. "And I met T.J. Watt." George Pickens helped grant Cole's wish of #Steelers season tickets through @MakeAWishPAWV today! pic.twitter.com/3xoXEBBuPX Happy to have them here: The Steelers hosted a group from the Monessen Positive Action Community Team (MPACT) at practice on Saturday as part of the team's community relations program. The motto for MPACT is 'you feel good about yourself when you do positive actions, and there is a positive way to do everything.' The program is part of the the Monessen School District, started in 2020 as an after-school program that aims to improve academic performance and student behavior. The team also hosted a group from Voices Without Violence. Voices Against Violence (VAV) grew out of a street outreach initiative by Richard Carrington, Sr. working with Pittsburgh gang members in 1992. The organization was formally established in 1995 in response to a growing need for holistic community-based programs that serve youth involved with gangs, drugs, and guns in South Pittsburgh. Voices Against Violence became one of the first and foremost anti-violence organizations in Pittsburgh, pioneering programs in Street Mediation, Conflict Resolution, and Restorative Justice Practices. Voices Against Violence is a successful, non-profit organization using The Pittsburgh Contingency, a registered 501c3, as its official, audited, fiscal conduit. The American Cancer Society was on hand at practice on Saturday, running a Sun Safety initiative in the Fan Zone area. On Saturday, @ACSPennsylvania distributed sunscreen at #SteelersCamp as part of the @NFL‚Äôs Crucial Catch Sun Safety initiative. pic.twitter.com/j8YbNFUDRC Friday, July 26 Young leaders visit camp: The Steelers hosted a group from Young Black Motivated Kings & Queens at practice on Friday as part of the team's community relations program. Young Black Motivated Kings & Queens (YBMKQ) is a community-based organization in Pittsburgh made up of some of the most dedicated young men and women in the city who have chosen to stand apart and show the community that young black kings and queens are active, motivated, and empowered to be the change. The mission is to counteract this narrative by embracing the agency and inviting others to do the same, no matter their circumstance or background. The organization engages elementary, middle and high-school-aged youth in becoming the leaders of tomorrow while serving the community. In addition to providing enriching opportunities for youth, and a safe space for them to come into, we also plan events for community members to come out to build strong connections with the youth, and network. Thursday, July 25 Changing kid's lives: The Steelers hosted a group from the Homewood Children's Village at practice on Thursday as part of the team's community relations program. The group was able to watch practice and meet with some of the players afterwards, getting pictures and autographs. The Homewood Children's Village is making a difference in the lives of kids in the Homewood area, reaching out to them, offering services for them to continue to grow, and taking every step to make sure they don't become a statistic. Because as we all know, it takes a village to raise a child. 2024 Offseason Monday, July 15 Batter up: Cameron Heyward hosted his annual Three Rivers Celebrity Softball Game at the Washington Wild Things Park on Saturday. The game featured Heyward, some of his teammates, and other area and national celebrities and benefited his foundation, The Heyward House. Heyward, who was the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year in 2023, has continued to give back to the community all offseason. Friday, June 28 Highsmith lends a hand: Linebacker Alex Highsmith, and his wife Alyssa, lent their hands on Friday to help those who were impacted by the recent fire at Second Avenue Commons in Pittsburgh. Those staying at the homeless shelter have been displaced since the fire, and Highsmith wanted to do something to assist them. Highsmith hosted a distribution of necessities, from t-shirts and sweatpants to slippers and bookbags, for the individuals to help them through the tough time. Highsmith also provided dinner for the participants at Pittsburgh Mercy, trying to do something to uplift their spirits. Thursday, June 20 Engaging with area youth: The rookies visited the Mel Blount Youth Home in Claysville, Pa., on Thursday, working with the Hall of Fame cornerback to help engage with youth from the surrounding area as a part of his Youth Leadership Initiative. "With the Youth Leadership Initiative, we're able to work with more kids and have a broader reach," said Blount. "One of the things that we've done is connected with other youth organizations around Western Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, Washington County, Greene County, Westmoreland County. So, we have a broader reach now. We're able to work and be more effective, reaching more kids. It gives kids, even kids who are not in the system, an opportunity to experience what our program has to offer and help them grow and develop." The idea behind the visit is to help inspire the kids who are taking part and teach the importance of teamwork as the kids go through a series of physical challenges designed for them to work together in teams. To wrap up community week, the rookies visited the @MelBlountYLI to participate team building activities and football drills with kids.üìù: https://t.co/atkpy7m9Jg pic.twitter.com/Xv2vPqBuxD Wednesday, June 19 Back to school: The rookies partnered with Jerome Bettis' Bus Stops Here Foundation on Wednesday for projects that are part of the foundation's cyber programs.

The yearly clinic was open to kids from kindergarten through 8th grade and featured the players teaching drills and encouraging the kids to be active and positive in their school, home and community life. In addition to the football side of it, there were carnival games for kids and their families to participate in and affordable food options through on-site food trucks.

Heyward was joined by many of his Steelers teammates for a fun day of golf that benefits The Heyward House Foundation. The mission of The Heyward House is to impact the lives of today's youth through childhood hunger prevention, promoting literacy, fighting cancer, supporting students and teachers and more. Kicking off camp: Quarterback Russell Willson helped to kick off a summer camp for the Boys & Girls Club of Western Pennsylvania (BGCWPA) through his Why Not You Foundation. The foundation also made a $50,000 donation to the BGCWPA. Wilson and his wife, Grammy Award winning artist Ciara, work together on the Why Not You Foundation, which has a longer-term vision to support communities of Pittsburgh by establishing Why Not You Centers in partnership with leading local nonprofits. Centers will help youth and teens foster "why not you" attitudes that allow them to dream and reach for their dreams. Since 2014, Why Not You Foundation has given millions to deserving nonprofits partners in an effort to fight cyclical poverty and drive greater equity for youth in the spaces of education and health. Sunday, June 9 Football and life lessons: Flag football tournaments have become popular throughout Western Pennsylvania, but over the weekend a special one was held to celebrate Juneteenth, and the Steelers were a part of it. The Steelers took part in the Juneteenth Open Invitation Flag Football Tournament at Mellon Park on Sunday, a two-day tournament that featured teams from all over Pennsylvania. The purpose for the tournament was two-fold, a fun-filled football fest and an avenue to teach kids the history behind Juneteenth. Graham also took part in a CPR training session in conjunction with the American Heart Association and Pittsburgh native and Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin and his Chasing M's Foundation.

The evening was highlighted by a seven-on-seven flag football game, featuring an array of former Steelers players like Jerome Bettis, Ben Roethlisberger and Hines Ward, as well as celebrities such as rapper Fedd the God, actor and comedian Billy Gardell, and actor/musician Chip Esten. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin and Hall of Famer and former Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau served as the coaches for the game. The competition was intense, with Polamalu's team coming out on top. "It's the city that is hosting us tonight in a lot of ways. In that mindset, I am very grateful to be back, to see all of the faces here, to see the team," said Polamalu. "It's nice to be back in the fold in a very meaningful way. We do a lot of charitable work for the community, but to come back here, bring back the alumni, give back to the team." The event benefits the Neighborhood Resilience Project, an organization the Steelers have a strong bond with. "Considering the Neighborhood Resilience Project, and the Neighborhood Resilience Institute, and the amazing things they have done, this is great to be a part of," said Polamalu. "The Resilience Project, first and foremost it's a framework that allows the community to heal within. Oftentimes, when people look at trauma, especially the case of trauma in communities, you have a separate figure that is trying to impose certain programs on a community. Some of them are helpful, some not so helpful. The beautiful thing about the Neighborhood Resilience Project is that it's healing from within. It's a framework that allows people that live in the community to talk to people in positions of power, and then they become people of power, and enlighten us to bring healing to the community." The organization brought hundreds of kids from the Greater Pittsburgh region to enjoy a night where they can see Steelers legends up close. "This night means so much to them," said Rev. Paul T. Abernathy, CEO of Neighborhood Resilience Project. "For them to have a chance to see some of the Steelers legends, Super Bowl champions, Hall of Famers. It's bringing so much excitement to our youth. "This event is so fun. Just to have an event this fun and offer it as a night of enjoyment for our region to come together and celebrate all that people in our community have accomplished establishing resiliency, it's just incredible." The vision of the Neighborhood Resilience Project is to inspire a movement in which suffering people are raised up from the ashes of trauma in unconditional love to become empowered healers, community builders, and positive change makers. The project is rooted in the Gospel and teachings of the Orthodox Church, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s. "This has been a tremendous blessing to us," said Rev. Abernathy. "Troy and Theodora Polamalu are truly gems, not only for our organization, but the entire community. The Steelers organization is showing us tonight that as a region we can come together, we can remember those who are suffering the most among us. We can as a region, with this kind of leadership from the Steelers and the Polamalus heal the pain in our communities. This is inspiring so many people in our community. The excitement in our underserved community is beyond words, it's bringing new life to us all." Saturday, May 11 Pizza, pizza: Cameron Heyward won the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year, and so far in 2024 he has shown he has no plans of slowing down. Heyward has been involved in multiple community events this year already, the latest partnering with Little Caesars Love Kitchen to provide free pizza to people in the Homewood community. On Saturday, @littlecaesars partnered with @97HeywardHouse to surprise the Homewood community with pizza from their Little Caesars Love Kitchen. pic.twitter.com/3qrQqb0Ubi Thursday, May 9 Celebrating a special day: Last year, Miles Killebrew wanted to do something special for his 30th birthday, and for someone who isn't a fan of big parties and a lot of attention, he found the perfect way to celebrate. He enjoyed it so much, he opted for the same celebration this year. Instead of making his birthday celebration all about himself, he celebrated his birthday, which is May by hanging out with patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, hanging out and delivering gifts to unsuspecting kids. It was a great day for the kids, who were smiling from ear to ear as their spirits picked up with the fun surprise, which included Killebrew dressing up as Batman. Wednesday, May 8 Birthday time: Defensive tackle Cameron Heyward celebrated his birthday on Monday, but on Wednesday, he threw a party for others. Heyward hosted his annual birthday bash at Dave & Busters for a group of local kids, including many who are served through The Caring Place. The kids were able to play video games with Heyward and some of his teammates, as well as enjoy dinner and just have fun interacting with each other. The Caring Place an organization he has been involved with, including as part of Cam's Kindness Week last year. The Caring Place offers programs to support children and families who are grieving after a devastating loss. And the statistics are sad, as one in 20 kids will have a parent die before they graduate from high school. Heyward is one of those statistics and that is why he wanted to give back. His father, Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward died when he was just 16-years old, the summer before his senior year of high school. Very thankful to have @steelers teammates, @97HeywardHouse @CaringPlacePa all partner up to spend some time @ Dave & Busters for some pretty great kids!!! Tuesday, April 23 Smiles all around: Quarterback Russell Wilson brought smiles, and Terrible Towels, to patients at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh on Tuesday. Wilson stopped by the hospital to visit with the kids, something that lifted the spirits of everyone he spent time with. And Wilson himself had a fantastic time. "What I have learned is that much is given, much is required," said Wilson. "I believe that." During the visit, Wilson took time to learn more about each one of the kids, learn about their ability to fight through adversity as some have gone beyond what doctors could have ever expected in their health battles. "It's about their fight," said Wilson. "It's inspiring to see that. To see the mentality. It's important not only for me, but so many of us other athletes to be able express how much these young kids mean to us. "The thing I always realized, doing a lot of things with cancer, and things like that for kids, you realize that number one you never know if it's somebody you know, number two you never know if it's somebody that could be yours one day. To be able to give back and be able to impact is important." Wilson is no stranger to giving back in this manner, something he did previously in other cities where he has played and something he truly does from the heart. "My dad was always in hospitals, my mom was an ER nurse," said Wilson. "I've seen a lot. I've seen a lot of miracles happen too. I've seen a lot of good things happen. "When you go into a room with a lot of love, a lot of hope, anything is possible. When you have great doctors and nurses and people that are spending so much time for these young, amazing kids, you want to cherish those moments." Amazing visit today @ChildrensPGH!!! The sweetest kids! Keep fighting! Keep overcoming! üñ§üíõ pic.twitter.com/4aGtY2ht4s Friday, April 12 Set for success: Cameron Heyward and The Heyward House hosted the annual Suiting Up for Success Soiree at the Grand Concourse, celebrating the accomplishments of local high school seniors. Heyward celebrated male high school seniors in the Pittsburgh area, all chosen by their schools for their leadership, character and ability to overcome challenges faced by today's youth. The Heyward House provided each of them with a custom suit and all the accessories through his 'Craig's Closet' program, as well as a photo shoot and a private dinner with Heyward. The program is one of the many that earned Heyward the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award. Craig's Closet has been a staple for The Heyward House since 2018, launched in honor of his late father, Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward, who died from a brain tumor in 2006, at just 39 years old. His father played football at the University of Pittsburgh, and when he arrived as a freshman running back, he had only one suit, something he was grateful to have since he came from a single-parent home with six siblings. With so many young men in Pittsburgh facing the same challenge of not having a suit that they could wear to a job interview, internship, events and more, Heyward produced a plan. Craig's Closet provides free dress clothes to help young men as they move forward in life, and the Suiting Up for Success program is an extension of that. "The idea came from my dad," said Heyward. "When he grew up, he only had one suit. A lot of his friends didn't have suits at all. This is a creative way we thought of to give back to the community and help prepare young men for jobs, or homecoming, moving forward in life. You never know how much a suit can help you present yourself." Wednesday, April 10 Cam Heyward Day: Wednesday was declared 'Cam Heyward Day' in the City of Pittsburgh, honoring the 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year. Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Pittsburgh City Council presented him with a proclamation for his work that has benefited so many in the city. "I just want to thank you for all of the work that you have done," said Gainey. "You have done a lot of work in the city. I am appreciative, because it speaks volumes of how you use your platform. I always think you should use your platform to uplift other people, and you have done that. I just want to personally say thank you. "And I like the way you tackle quarterbacks. I appreciate that." Gainey went on to read the proclamation honoring Heyward for winning the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award, recognizing him for his on and off the field efforts. "He is among the most respected names in the National Football League," the proclamation read. "Throughout his 13-year career he has been deeply involved in helping the community and always using his platform for good. Throughout his distinguished career, Cam has exemplified the highest standards of professionalism, compassion and consistency, going above and beyond the call of duty, and providing life-changing care for support of youth throughout the region. "Today is your day. We appreciate you. Today is Cam Heyward Day." Heyward, who has been a staple in the community since he was drafted by the Steelers in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft, was humbled to be honored by the city when he was born and played his entire career. "Thank you to Mayor Gainey, (City) Council, and everybody out here today," said Heyward. "When I talk about using my platform to draw awareness or help others out, that's not accomplished without a village behind me. It's not done without people taking an effort to give back. I would like to think I am a representative of that. "I am very appreciative of this proclamation. When I tell my kids today is Cam Heyward Day, they might freak out a little bit and hopefully I can get a cupcake on top of that. My kids, I am just trying to show them the way and I am trying to lead my family and provide for them a model of how to represent your city. Not everybody gets to be a Pittsburgh Steeler, but when you are a Pittsburgh Steeler, there is a level of consistency, a standard to be held and a responsibility to the city. That is something I will always do. We've got a lot more work to do, and I am looking forward to doing it." Saturday, April 6 Alex Highsmith Day: Steelers linebacker Alex Highsmith had his day in the sun when Wilmington, North Carolina celebrated 'Alex Highsmith Day' on April 6. Highsmith, who grew up in Wilmington, was recognized by Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo for his work on and off the field. Highsmith was honored in particular for his work with the Highsmith Family Foundation, which is dedicated to the advancement and enrichment of underserved youth, professional development of our nation's educators, and providing opportunities for growth and connection to flourish. The foundation does work in Wilmington, Pittsburgh, and Charlotte, where he attended college. He also works closely with the Barbara Highsmith Reading Academy. "God has blessed me with this platform, to just be a light for him and do it all for his glory," said Highsmith. "So, knowing that the main reason I have this platform is not just to play football but to make a difference and be a blessing to others. Knowing that I have this platform, I know it comes with great responsibility and that is to give back to others and make a difference." Highsmith is committed to the Pittsburgh community as well, hosting events for various organizations, while attending team and community events in an effort to give back and make a difference. "Ultimately, I know that I can make a lasting difference in the community," said Highsmith. "Just by going out and doing different things with the kids and being a role model for them, that's what matters to me most."

==================================================

Steelers players dazzled on the runway Steelers.com The Steelers will play in primetime on Sunday Night Football against the Dallas Cowboys, but on Friday night, they put on another primetime spectacular. Fashion and football once again met head on at Steelers Style, the team's annual fashion show, which celebrated a milestone 50th Anniversary this year. As a part of the celebration, players took the theme 'Suit Up' to heart, hitting the runway at Stage AE in their best looks, where all that glittered on this night was black and gold. Guests were greeted with a football feel from the time they arrived, walking the green football carpet where they paused to have a moment to shine in front of the cameras. As they awaited the main attraction, those in attendance enjoyed culinary delights while they were able to preview the latest fashions from the Steelers Pro Shop. The show, which was co-chaired by Art and Greta Rooney and Mike and Kiya Tomlin, is the team's signature community event and loved by all who attend. "This year we are celebrating the golden anniversary of our fashion show and its 50-year history," said Greta Rooney. "I am fortunate to be a part of this for 24 years and very proud to say we have raised millions of dollars for our local charities. "You get to see our players off the field and on the stage. No helmet, with their families, personalities, and it makes for a fun night for everybody and for a good cause." While fashion was the main attraction, as Greta Rooney said it was all for a good cause. All proceeds benefited the UPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program, Cancer Bridges and the Chuck Noll Foundation. "Doing it for the charities, that is the biggest thing," said defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi, one of the show's co-captains along with Pat Freiermuth. "It's important to give back. It's amazing what we do here, the tradition. It's an honor to be selected as one of the co-captains." The players welcome the opportunity to combine fashion, team bonding and giving back to the community for a perfect evening filled with laughs, smiles and joy. "It's awesome that it benefits such great causes," said Freiermuth. "I really appreciate Mr. Rooney and Greta thinking of me to be a co-captain with Larry. It's awesome I get to be a focal point of such an amazing event. I have been at it every year I have been here. "It's an awesome event. Seeing all the Pittsburgh people out there supporting us not just on the field, but for this, is special."

(Alysa Rubin / Pittsburgh Steelers) This year's show was presented by Neighborhood Ford Store, PNC, UPMC, and UPMC Health Plan, who were all on board with supporting the causes. "I am always really honored by their support," said Kiya Tomlin. "These are such big supporters of our Pittsburgh community, and for them to value the causes that we are supporting for this event and support so whole heartedly, I am honored." When it comes to the fashion side of the show, Freiermuth and Ogunjobi are on the opposite spectrum, one happy to hang out in his sweats while the other has been tabbed as one of the best dressed on the squad by his teammates. "My fashion is simple and comfy," said Freiermuth. "I have five pairs of sweatpants and sweatshirts that I just rotate through. My girlfriend gets pretty mad at me. I like what I like and that's what I wear. "I do have a few suits, but I don't really wear them. If it's a primetime game I will, but I don't do anything crazy. "It's good to do the show, get dressed up once in a while, see all of the guys on the team, be around their families and stuff. There are some fashionable guys on the team, Larry, Minkah (Fitzpatrick). A lot of guys. I wouldn't classify myself as one of them." Ogunjobi, however, doesn't mind being classified as one of the best dressed. "It's cool. I enjoy fashion," said Ogunjobi. "It's one of those things where it's look good, feel good, play good. I always try and look presentable, because that's how my parents raised me. "When I first got in the league, I had guys like Christian Kirksey and Chris Smith take me under their wing when it comes to those kinds of things. I just thought it was cool. "Wearing certain things, doing certain things, especially being a big man I think it just kind of opens a lot of doors and it's cool." Ogunjobi is hands on with his fashion, picking out everything from the material to the design on custom suits. But he doesn't limit his style. "It's a combination of urban street wear, but I have a lot of suits, so obviously, classic and sophisticated," said Ogunjobi. "It is a mix of that." After an array of welcomes and sincere messages of thanks to all in attendance, it was time to get down to business. As 'Suit Up' was introduced as the theme for the night, a video of players dressed in their best was shown, while players took the stage in their own styles, showing off what Steelers Style is all about. But that was just a sneak peek. Before the players got going in their suits, they took the stage in their Sunday best…game jerseys. It was all about showing off their unique personalities, as they chose their own walkout songs and brought a bit of swag with them as they walked the runway, tossing giveaways to the crowd along the way. The game day vibe, with all of the latest fashions from the Steelers Pro Shop styled in fun and unique ways, brought energy with style and dancing taking center stage. It was then time to throw things back to where the fashion show started, with a video montage of Steelers Style through the years, featuring images of players from every decade from the 1970s to the present, as well as fashions through the years. It didn't stop there. The Steelers are also celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Super Bowl IX, the first Super Bowl the team won, and the night wouldn't have been complete without two stars from that team hitting the runway. Hall of Fame cornerback Mel Blount and legendary running back Rocky Bleier hit the stage to the excitement of the packed house. With the strongest female fan base in the NFL, it came as no surprise Women of Steel were highlighted in the show, with fashion and fun fully on display as Steelers wives took the stage. Players have their own unique style, and Russell Wilson and some of his teammates stepped out in his Good Man Brand, which he launched in 2016 and is made for the man-on-the-move who seeks timeless, authentic, and sustainable style with a premium, modern edge. Keeping it in the family, this year's 'halftime' musical performer was Mayce, the son of Mike and Kiya Tomlin. Mayce got into music at age 14 and has since embarked on a rap career, releasing the self-produced 'When Else But Now?' which features seven songs. Mayce recently opened for Poison frontman Bret Michaels on his Parti-Gras 2.0 tour at The Pavilion at Star Lake. And for Mayce, it was quite the change for him, going from walking in the fashion show when he was a kid, to now performing in it. "I walked a long time ago," said Mayce. "I was probably eight or so. It's been a while because it always was on a Friday night and I would be playing football. It's definitely a little weird. Just because I grew up around it to now being a legitimate part of it is kind of funny to me. "I love performing. I knew what the energy was going to be. I've seen other people do the show that I know, and they said it was a great time. "It was also a little bit special because I knew my entire family would be there, and there are multiple members of my family who had never seen me on stage including, but not limited to, my father." Mike Tomlin has shied away from seeing him perform because he never wanted to take the spotlight off his son, but the fashion show was different. "He's been such a big supporter of mine," said Mayce. "And for him to have the opportunity to see it, when I've been doing a lot of cool stuff lately and he's either at work or just doesn't want to be in the way. So, this is the one opportunity where he's like actually not in the way, he's going to be there anyway." Mayce performed one of his newest releases, 'Rock Your Body,' energizing the crowd, including his famous dad. "This is the song that I've been doing in all the Bret Michaels shows," said Mayce. "I make enough different kinds of music that I can kind of tailor it to the audience. I can switch it up and make something more fun, pop-like for the event." Fashions by Kiya Tomlin are always a highlight of the show, and once again her designs didn't disappoint. Models dazzled in her unique designs that earned her the title of Best Fashion Designer in Pittsburgh in the Pittsburgh CityPaper's 2023 Reader's Poll. "Our collection is for the fashion first fan," said Kiya Tomlin. "I am really excited, it's fashion forward, and stuff we are not used to seeing." Up next was what everyone was waiting for as the 'Suit Up' theme took center stage. Rookies first stepped out in custom suits designed by Surmesur, suits the players had a huge input in designing. From fittings to selecting everything from the pattern to the cut, it was a personalized experience, and it showed on the runway. On tap next were veteran players, some with their wives and kids, stepping out in their own style and having fun the entire time. "Honestly being able to hang out with the guys, get dressed up, sit around and eat together," said tight end Connor Heyward. "It's hanging out with each other. It's a good time for us to come together. It's guys, their wives and families. It's a cool thing. "I think the Rooneys have been doing it for a lot of years. It's a tradition that will keep on going in Pittsburgh for however long they can, probably forever. It's a good time. A good way for us to connect with the people who support us as well." While it was all in fun, don't think for a minute it wasn't competitive, as the annual swag awards are always heavily sought after. This year, though, it went a different direction, with two family swag awards presented. Russell Wilson and his wife Ciara and their kids as well as Donte Jackson and his daughters took the honors. The celebration of 50 years of Steelers Style was one that won't soon be forgotten.

About the charities: UPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program: The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Sports Medicine Concussion Program, established in 2000, is the first of its kind and largest ongoing clinical service and research program that focuses on diagnosis, evaluation and management of sports-related concussion in athletes of all levels. Led by Michael Collins, PhD, the program's internationally known team of clinicians and researchers are world leaders in studying the neurocognitive effects of sports-related concussion and pioneering the development of better methods of post-concussion evaluation to determine when it is safe for an athlete to return to sports. The team provides oversight and consultation to assist sports teams' medical staff in making objective return-to-play decisions after the occurrence of sports-related concussion. Cancer Bridges: Cancer Bridges supports those impacted by cancer through a variety of free programs and services and has been a proud beneficiary of Steelers Style since 1992. The organization provides a warm and welcoming environment for everyone impacted by cancer, including those with a diagnosis, survivors, and those who have a loved one with cancer or have experienced the loss of a loved one due to cancer. Cancer Bridges serves individuals of all ages and offers nearly 200 programs monthly, providing emotional, social, and informational tools for adults, youth, and families through counseling sessions, support groups, health and wellness programs, social activities, and more. Chuck Noll Foundation: The Steelers launched the Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research in 2016 to support continued research and education regarding brain injuries and treatment of sports-related concussions. The Foundation funds research that it believes is the most promising in the area of sports-related concussions and related conditions. To help best evaluate which research programs to fund, some of the most renowned neurosurgeons in the country serve on a national medical advisory panel.

Steelers make back to school special Steelers.com Students in the Pittsburgh area have returned to the classroom this fall, many of them with stylish new backpacks and necessary supplies thanks to the efforts of Steelers players the last few weeks. The Steelers had a back-to-school blitz, with multiple players stepping up to provide the essentials for the kids, something that is a priority for many in the organization. In all, the Steelers supported more than 4,500 kids with school supplies, some of them also receiving things like hair care, hygiene kits and more. "Back to school is the beginning of the season and really it's an opportunity for our guys to start the season strong," said Blayre Holmes-Davis, the Steelers senior director of community relations. "This year we have had more back-to-school events than we've had previously, including new guys stepping up. We know there's a lot of communities that talk about back-to-school time, they talk about school supplies and everything. But not every school district and not every student has the necessities to start the school year strong. That can be from having a haircut to just having a highlighter and a notebook and everything that they need. "I think it's great for our guys to want to pour back into the community. Also, being there to want to give things out in person and make sure that they see them face to face to say we're here to support you. While they play on Sunday, they make time during the week to make sure they're in the community as well. "It's really meaningful to see the guys go into those schools and provide them with those supplies. But also let them know that they're there to support them. They're there to make sure that not only the beginning of the school year, but throughout the entire school year. They want them to know that they're there to support them and cheer them on as much as our community does on Sunday." The team kicked it off when they joined forces with the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Penguins Foundation for the 12th Annual Pittsburgh Public Schools Back to School Event at Acrisure Stadium. This year, Cameron Heyward's foundation, The Heyward House, and Russell Wilson's Why Not You Foundation, worked hand-in-hand with the team and the Mentoring Partnership to provide support for kids and families, with the theme, 'Students first…Always, in all ways.' "Much is given, much is required," said Wilson. "I think the ability to give back and care about our youth is key. We were once kids who were trying to make it and trying to be inspired and trying to dream big. For us, for me and Ciara in particular, we have our own kids, and we always try and inspire others. "But the most important thing is encouraging kids, why not you. If we can do it, you can do it." To give the kids a fresh start for school, the Steelers provided haircuts, hairstyles and manicures, giving everyone a self-esteem boost. Working with The Heyward House and Why Not You Foundation, they also provided hygiene kits and books. In addition, they connected the students with much needed resources that will benefit them throughout their educational endeavors. "For some parents there can be a lot of anxiety where they are thinking about do our kids have a backpack, all the right amenities to go to school," said Heyward. "It was about giving the kids a jumpstart on the school year by providing stuff and sending them on their merry way for a good school year." Students were able to attend the event in person and take advantage of all of the activities or participate in the drive-thru version where they were able to still get free school supplies and other essentials without having to leave their car.

(Alysa Rubin / Pittsburgh Steelers) Linebacker T.J. Watt and his wife Dani spent one of their off days visiting multiple schools in the Pittsburgh area to give back. Watt made a stop at Pittsburgh King, where he read to the students and then handed out supply bags to help the kids in the school year. "It's fun. It really is," said Watt. "To see the excitement, to feel the excitement, I haven't been around a bunch of screaming kids at 9:30 in the morning ever. "It's fun to be able to do it with Dani. Having a little one on the way, it puts things more into perspective about people who are less fortunate and don't have the school supplies or the toiletries to be able to go to school and not have to worry about those things, and that's what we're trying to provide. "It's such a busy time of year, but it's so important on these Tuesdays, our off days, that we take the time to get out in the community and show people that we're not just on television and we are separated. I want to bridge that gap and show people that we care, and we want to help them as much as possible." He also visited Pittsburgh Milliones, where he took questions from the kids and again handed out supply bags. "That was funny. They asked my favorite class, and I don't have a favorite class if I am being honest with anyone," said Watt. "The questions, it's always surreal when kids are nervous to ask questions. I have to remember, to them I am some big guy. But I am such a normal goofball that I forget that sometimes. The kids had great questions, and it was fun to be able to answer some of them." Watt did the event in conjunction with The Education Partnership, who work to provide school supplies to students and teachers in under-resourced schools across Southwestern Pennsylvania. The agency has served more than 374,770 students in 201 schools and given out more than $65,000,000 worth of school resources. Tight end Pat Freiermuth also worked with The Education Partnership for a school distribution. Freiermuth has always been passionate about giving back to the Pittsburgh community, loving the ability to interact with others, especially with kids while bringing them joy. "I want to be involved in the community more," said Freiermuth. "My parents, really my whole family are teachers, so just being able to give back to the public school system is something I take pride in. "It's personal for me. My family is involved in the public school system and just seeing what they go through with funding and so forth, what kids experience, I just want to help." Freiermuth worked with Pittsburgh Mifflin to provide supplies to the students there to aid them in the school year. He also provided plenty of smiles as he spent time with the kids. "Nothing beats it," said Freiermuth. "It puts a smile on their face, it puts a smile on my face. It's good to be in a position where I can give back." Linebacker Alex Highsmith hosted his 3rd Annual Back to School Bash for 300 area students at the LaRosa Youth Club in McKeesport. Highsmith handed out backpacks, books and school supplies to the students through the Alex Highsmith Family Foundation. In addition, the foundation provided free haircuts, water bottles, and to-go meals to ensure a nutritious option at the start of the school year. "We are incredibly excited to have hosted this event once again and to continue our mission of giving back to the community," said Highsmith. "Providing these resources helps ensure that every child has the tools they need to succeed academically and start the school year with confidence. "I know how important education is, especially at a young age. Growing up with both of my parent's educators, it was important to me my who life. That is one of the pillars of my foundation, impacting youth through education. Being able to give back to those kids is such an honor." Defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi hosted his third annual Back To School event, providing backpacks and school supplies to 300 kids at Urban Academy in Pittsburgh. "I love having the opportunity to give every single year and to be an integral part of the start of the school year," said Ogunjobi. "Great school supplies are the foundation of a successful school year, it's always good to come back and see familiar faces, I can't wait to see what the future holds for this group of bright students." Ogunjobi has worked with Urban Academy the past three years, a school known for their S.T.E.M. program, something that hits home for him as he earned his degree in computer science and biology from North Carolina Charlotte. "The Urban Academy community thanks Larry and the Pittsburgh Steelers for their ongoing commitment to our students and community," said Chase Patterson, CEO of Urban Academy. "For the third consecutive year, Larry's generosity is making a difference in supporting our student's success. Larry and the Steelers organization continue to demonstrate their overarching dedication to uplifting and investing in young people's futures. On behalf of the entire Urban Academy family, thank you for your unwavering support and partnership." Safety DeShon Elliott is new to Pittsburgh, but he has already immersed himself in the community with his back-to-school event. "The kids are our pillars. Growing up, football was important to me, but my parents also preached education," said Elliott. "I am not just doing back to school supplies, but clothes and shoes too. It's hard for parents, especially single parent homes, and I have two sisters who are single mothers, and it can be hard to try and provide everything you need for school. That takes a burden off the kids and the moms. The kids can then just focus on their education. "And this is an opportunity for me to give back to my hometown, which is now here." Elliott took a group of kids shopping for their back-to-school needs as well as shoes and clothes, making sure they were set for the new school year. He also spent time interacting with the kids, being present, which is sometimes one of the most important aspects. "It means a lot," said Elliott. "I am giving back, but being there, showing up, that means a lot to kids. Being able to talk to them, and them learning from me, who I am, answering questions. Talking to kids about football, other things. I just want to be hands on and really get to know them."

Labriola On Tomlin on Russ, making trades, blocking FGs Steelers.com Q. Weather delays are somewhat regular occurrences during training camp and through the preseason, but are more rare during the regular season. With the understanding that both teams are going through the same thing, what do you believe is the best way to spend that time during a delay, or maybe a better way to put it is to minimize the negative way that delay could impact the players and coaches?
A. We have no control over the length of time that the delay is. I really focus my energies on how we bring them out of the delay. And so a lot of strategic things, from a time perspective, are done with our strength staff and our nutrition staff and our training staff as to determine what's the best means of going about warming them back up, how long that should take, without doing too much in terms of burning useful fuel. The extended periods of time, it's just like an extended halftime of a Super Bowl. It's unique. There are certain processes that you go through in terms of getting them ready for action, and how much time it lasts is less relevant. Guys oftentimes get what they need, communicate regarding schematic strategy, listen to music, etc. It's handled different ways by different people, individually. How you come out of it is most important, from a decision-making, from a strategy perspective. Q. Is providing food a part of it?
A. We always have food in the locker room, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, things of that nature. Fuel-like food. That's just a regular component of our everyday existence in 2024. Q. How did it go this week in practice with Russell Wilson? Did you start to see some of the things from him on the field that you had talked about wanting to see from him?
A. No question. First and foremost, my No. 1 agenda was that I wanted him to be able to display his health, his ability to not only move but protect himself. I was really comfortable with what I saw there. The rest of the equation is about knocking the rust off and gaining a rapport, a relationship with the battery of receivers and things of that nature. And I thought it was a really good week from that perspective. Q. On Dallas' final offensive play in last Sunday's game, it was a fourth-and-goal from the 4-yard line. It seemed that No. 1, Jalen Tolbert, was not in the end zone while running most of his route. Would it have been legal for a defender to have his hands on him before the ball was thrown since it was not 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage?
A. You get one continuous contact inside of 5 yards. And so if (Tolbert) was chucked at the line of scrimmage, that constitutes one contact. Whatever contact you get is one continual contact inside of 5 yards. And so certainly he was eligible to be rerouted, disrupted in some way, but that's the strict letter of the language: one continuous chuck inside of 5 yards. Q. So could a defensive back be riding him all the way across the field, just because the ball was not in the air and it was within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage?
A. If it was continuous. But I don't know that that's a realistic conversation, that you're going to maintain continuous contact with someone going across the football field. Q. When you have an issue with a player's effort, what is your opinion of calling out that player in front of the team?
A. There are levels to addressing it, to be honest with you. I can deal with it one-on-one. I can deal with it in a small group, or I can take it to the big group. And really it depends on how often it occurs or the level of egregiousness that's determining the options that I employ. Q. So when you're determining those options, are you not only thinking about the specific individual but the whole team as well?
A. You know, it's probably a little bit of both. A big component of team – you've got 53 guys on a football team – is people's ability to learn from issues regarding others. That's how you keep the collective moving forward. And so most of the time, when you're addressing it in a small group, or a larger group for that matter, it's done with that spirit in mind, not only to correct the action of the individual, but to use the infraction to educate the larger body. Good players, smart players, mature players, professional players are those who can learn from the issues of others. Q. When it comes to offensive play-calling, do you believe it's necessary for the offense to have shown you during the week of practice that it was capable of executing the play before it's called in a game?
A. It depends on the relationship with the play. If it's a new concept, certainly. If it's a Day 1 concept, if it's something that we have been working over the totality of team development, it may get called in-game without being repped that particular week. It is about our experience, our knowledge, and our relationship or history with the concept you're talking about. But definitively, if it is new, you definitely want to see physical evidence of execution. Q. So by new, you mean if it's something that you put in for that team?
A. Correct. Q. There's a lot of lore about instances where a play didn't work all week in practice, but then it was called in the game and it resulted in a touchdown that won the game. Is that all fiction?
A. Most of the time it might have worked, maybe not that week, but there's a history there that makes you comfortable enough to call it anyway. And that's what I'm talking about, in terms of how much exposure you have to the concept, the history with the concept. You can call the play two times during the week, and two different issues derail the play, but if you have run it 16 times over the previous four months, therein lies your comfort. Q. The NFL trading deadline is at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 5, and let's pretend that you're interested in acquiring a player, either a specific guy or a specific position. Since we're into the regular season, does General Manager Omar Khan handle all of the preliminary work – making contact, gauging interest, getting an idea of the cost, or are you involved in that as well?
A. I'm involved in the interest, and maybe the communication. I've been in the league a long time, Omar has as well. We've got unique relationships with some of our peers across the league. And so I'm not opposed to being included from that perspective, but in terms of the logistical component of the cost and things of that nature, that's more Omar's space. I'm less concerned about that, more concerned about the talent (of the player), why he's available, what the issues might be in terms of player management, etc. But in terms of interacting with other organizations and their personnel, he and I have both been in it a long time. We've got cool, deep relationships with a lot of people, and so that's oftentimes a collaborative effort. Q. Then what happens? What's the procedure? When do you and Omar and Art Rooney II get together and figure out whether this is something you might want to consider?
A. It is organic and continual. I don't know that it's an email saying that at 3 p.m. we're going to get together and discuss this. There's a fluidity to it, and it is continual. It is part of our daily existence. The interest in the pursuit and the acquisition of football talent is ongoing every day of our professional lives. I know from an attention standpoint, the trade deadline gets a lot of attention, but it is legitimately everyday business of our lives. Every day the transaction wire comes out. There are things to discuss regarding global personnel, potential guys who are available, and for whatever reason. It's just daily procedures for us. Q. But does the actual setting of a deadline, especially in the NFL, spur action?
A. It spurs activity, but I don't know that it changes the nature of how we communicate, plan, and have meaty discussions regarding the potential acquisition of people. It's just whether or not the plan lands, it comes to fruition, people are legitimately available. All those things maybe accelerate around the deadline, but I don't know that it changes our behavior or our interactions. Q. Raiders Coach Antonio Pierce announced earlier in the week that Aidan O'Connell would start at quarterback today in place of Gardner Minshew. What do you know about him after this week of preparation?
A. I know he threw the ball, and he threw the ball a lot at Purdue. He's a rhythm and anticipatory thrower. He's comfortable with five eligibles out in the route. That appears to be the strength of his game. But as far as (Antonio Pierce) is concerned, he and that young man had a lot of positive experiences at the end of last year. (O'Connell) won some games for him, (Pierce) was able to secure the permanent job and drop the interim coach tag. And so I imagine those shared experiences create a bond there that's not really surprising in that he named him the starter this week. Q. So he's not a rookie. Is he experienced? What category would he fall into?
A. He is a young guy, and he grew a lot last year, but I would imagine the turnover in offensive coordinator and play-caller kind of makes him somewhat inexperienced again, because there's a lack of continuity there when you go through transition and change. Q. Brock Bowers is a rookie tight end who's leading the Raiders in receiving so far. Often, you learn about players by talking to their college teammates. What did your Georgia guys tell you about him?
A. They didn't need to tell me a thing. I saw him on their video. When I was at Georgia looking at guys like George Pickens and Broderick Jones and others who have come through there, this guy jumped out on tape. His best year in Athens might have been his freshman year. He is no surprise. He is legitimate. The things that he's doing right now are very much on his SEC video. He can create separation at break points. He has great run-after. He can break tackles. He's got a really good feel for the game. He's good at high-pointing the ball. He's got good body control. He's got the fine motor skills of a much smaller guy. I don't know that any of us are really surprised by what we're seeing from him. Q. How are field goals blocked in the NFL, because for example it doesn't seem that coming off the edge works very often because of the snap-hold-kick efficiency of specialists at this level?
A. I think kicks are blocked by technique and opportunity. That's what I preach to the guys. What I mean is that you better have a really consistent approach to technique and urgency, and oftentimes negligence of the operation of the field goal unit determines whether or not there's a legitimate opportunity there. What I mean is, as a penetrator you go hard, you get as far into the line of scrimmage as you can, you get your hand up, try to get it in the flight of the ball, and if it's a miss-hit and a low trajectory, you've got an opportunity for a block. Same thing off the edge. You've got to have a hair-trigger. You've got to ball-key. You jump into a gap, or you're coming off the edge, you're making yourself skinny, and you're turning and cranking to a block point. You've got an opportunity to block that kick, maybe if the snap is a little bit off, or the management of the hold is a little bit off. And so it is technique and opportunity. But the opportunity is not going to present itself unless you position yourself technically, and that's what we talk about as a kick block unit. We've always got to be on. We've always got to have a hair-trigger in terms of getting off the ball. We've always got to exercise all the proper techniques in order to make ourselves opportunistic, but we realize whether or not we block a kick all the time is not exclusively up to us. It's about the behavior of the other unit.

==================================================

Asked and Answered Asked and Answered: Oct. 13 Steelers.com Let's get to it: BYRON BLEDSOE FROM EASTPOINTE, MI: I like Coach Mike Tomlin. I believe he is an excellent coach and I would never suggest the Steelers look elsewhere for someone to be their head coach. My question about Tomlin is just his demeanor on the sidelines. At times I think players need to have a fire lit underneath them, and getting a little loud and showing some emotion can be the means by which that happens. Evening tipping over a Gatorade bucket, or anything that would display your displeasure with the way the players are performing might get them playing better. In your estimation, do you think that this is sometimes a valuable asset?
ANSWER: I believe it's the fans who want to see a coach dump a Gatorade bucket, or yell and scream, or otherwise make a public display on the sideline after something bad happens during a game. Fans are angry, and they want to see their team's head coach show anger because it makes them feel better. But let me ask you, which great NFL coaches ever made a public display like flipping a tray of Gatorade on the sideline? Not Chuck Noll or Don Shula or Tom Landry or Bill Belichick. There is a famous clip of Vince Lombardi yelling, "What the hell's going on out there? Nobody tackling. Nothing but grab, grab, grab." But nobody even would have known he was yelling if he hadn't been caught by an NFL Films microphone. This is professional football, and the players are grown men. Certainly, there is a place for a coach to show anger, but doing it in such a public setting is no way to earn, or keep, the players' respect. And I can tell you that during Monday video review of the previous day's game, things can get very loud on the second floor of the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex. MICHAEL FATTIBENE FROM ALLISON PARK, PA: Are there any statistics tracking the team's performance when the stadium plays "Renegade" before a big defensive series where we need to make a defensive stand? It surely seems much more often than not, the Steelers fail to deliver on said stand, as painfully evidenced (again) in the fourth quarter of the Dallas game. It seems more the exception that we actually make a big play and get the stop.
ANSWER: You do understand, or at least I would hope you do, that playing "Renegade" at Acrisure Stadium is a part of the gameday entertainment experience. Fans in attendance enjoy the atmosphere it creates both visually with the twirling Terrible Towels and the juxtaposition of the music with the highlights shown on the Jumbotron. Playing "Renegade" is not some sort of football tactic designed to unleash mystical powers that will create a big play for the Steelers defense, nor is it intended to be a supernatural motivating force for the players. As for statistics "tracking the team's performance when the stadium plays 'Renegade' before a big defensive series," I don't know anyone who has that much free time. Maybe you'd like to volunteer. And even if you undertake that chore, I have no interest in your findings. It's entertainment. MATTHEW RHOADES FROM LATROBE, PA: Is it a possibility that there could be a rule to move kickers back on kickoffs to limit the ball flying out of the end zone, or it is not possible to change midseason?
ANSWER: It is not a possibility. Rules are not changed in the middle of a season. The next opportunity to amend or change or scrap the new kickoff rules will come during the NFL Owners Meetings next March. JASON PRASTER FROM SAN ANTONIO, TX: If my research is correct, since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, the Steelers have used only four first-round draft picks on quarterbacks. The Pittsburgh Steelers' philosophy has been to build championship teams through the draft, which they accomplished with the 1970 pick of Terry Bradshaw and the 2004 pick of Ben Roethlisberger. So, why when Arthur Smith was hired did the Steelers decide to sign a veteran QB in Russell Wilson and make a trade to the Bears for QB Justin Fields and not make an attempt to draft a quarterback like Jayden Daniels who would probably have fit Smith's offensive scheme?
ANSWER: Jayden Daniels was the second overall pick of the 2024 NFL Draft, and Washington had the opportunity to pick him because it was 4-13 during the 2023 season. The Steelers were 10-7 in 2023, and so they were in no position to have any chance at drafting a player such as Daniels, and moving up high into the first round to pick such a player is very, very expensive. The Carolina Panthers, as an example, moved from ninth overall in the 2023 NFL Draft to first overall to pick Bryce Young, and to do that they sent Chicago the No. 9 and No. 61 picks in the 2023 NFL Draft, plus their No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, plus 5-year veteran WR D.J. Moore, who had averaged 73 catches for 1,040 yards and 4.3 touchdowns after entering the NFL a No. 1 pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. Through the first dozen draft picks last April, 6 quarterbacks – Caleb Williams, Daniels, Drake Maye, Michael Penix, J.J. McCarthy, and Bo Nix – had been selected. The Steelers drafted 20th overall. There was no realistic chance to do what you suggest. PAT CREEL FROM CLAYTON, NC: It's hard to see on TV how receivers are being covered, hence my question. Are the Steelers receivers having a hard time getting open? I know they are young and inexperienced and it takes time for a receiver to learn how to get open in the NFL. I also know the offensive line is young and inexperienced and has had some injury issues. So is Justin Fields just not able to find an open receiver? Are the receivers not able to get open? Or is the offensive line not giving Fields enough time to find the open guy?
ANSWER: Based on your question, I would say that deep down you know why the Steelers passing game has been struggling through the early portion of this regular season. There are times when Justin Fields might miss an open receiver, just as there are times when none of the receivers is open, and/or the pass protection doesn't provide enough time for one of those things to happen. And the reason those things aren't happening on a more regular basis is because the receivers are young and inexperienced, the offensive line is young and inexperienced and has had injury issues, and Fields is a young guy in the first year of a new offense and still Is learning the craft of being an NFL quarterback. And there are no quick fixes for any and all of that. RICKY SMITH FROM PENSACOLA, FL: I had high hopes for Roman Wilson. Where in the world is Roman Wilson? I have been a tad busy lately and admit I have fallen behind on my Steelers news. Can you give us an update on No. 10? Is he still in the Steelers plans for the future?
ANSWER: Roman Wilson is certainly in the Steelers' plans for the future. In fact, I believe he's in their plans for the present, as in the 2024 season. But Wilson was injured on the sixth snap of the first practice in pads at Saint Vincent College, and so there was a lot of on-field work he missed. Wilson wasn't able to practice at all during training camp, and he also wasn't healthy enough to play in any of the three preseason games. So where Roman Wilson is right now is a rookie who's trying to learn what it takes to play in the NFL. He has been a regular participant in practice for some time now, and he's getting close, but another thing holding him back was that all the missed time removed him from consideration on special teams. And extra receivers typically need to be capable of contributing on special teams to get a helmet on game days. But it will happen for Roman Wilson. Maybe soon. CHARLES KONOP FROM NEWPORT NEWS, VA: It seems obvious to me and others that T.J. Watt gets held quite a bit. With Watt drawing so much attention from opponents and being double-teamed and triple-teamed, shouldn't the Steelers be able to scheme up better stunts for other players?
ANSWER: What you have right now is a situation where Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig are out with injuries, and DeMarvin Leal is on injured reserve. Cam Heyward already is a priority for opponents in passing situations, and as you referenced in your question T.J. Watt is going to draw a lot of attention. With the exception of instances of a bust in protection where a pass-rusher is allowed to come free, the best a scheme usually can do is create a one-on-one matchup that's a mismatch. Then it's up to the defender to win that matchup. Dick LeBeau always said the best he could do in terms of scheming for a pass-rusher was to create a matchup vs. a tight end or a running back. Then it was up to the defender to win that matchup.

==================================================

Asked and Answered Asked and Answered: Oct. 10 Steelers.com Let's get to it: DARIN FLIPPO FROM JONESBORO, TN: Please give your opinion on the Diontae Johnson trade given the current state of the offense. What value has that trade given us thus far?
ANSWER: The Steelers traded a starting wide receiver in Diontae Johnson for a starting cornerback in Donte Jackson, and there also was a swapping of draft picks with Carolina getting pick No. 240 from the Steelers, and the Steelers get pick No. 178 from the Panthers.
By the tone of your question I surmise you are more of a fan of offense than defense. Anyway, so far this season, Johnson, 28 years old, has started all 5 games for Carolina and played 80 percent of the offensive snaps. He has been targeted 45 times, with 23 catches for 262 yards (11.4 average) and 2 touchdowns. Jackson, 29 years old in November, has started all 5 games for the Steelers and played 95 percent of the defensive snaps. He has 2 interceptions that he returned 51 yards, 4 passes defensed, and 17 tackles, including 1 for loss. Jackson has value to the Steelers beyond his statistics because he's capable of playing opposite a cornerback who often follows the opponent's No. 1 receiver, which allows for more flexibility in coverage schemes. Not all outside cornerbacks can do that. Not having Diontae Johnson undoubtedly has impacted the pass offense in a negative way, but having Donte Jackson undoubtedly has impacted the pass defense in a positive way, because he clearly is a significant upgrade over the cornerbacks the Steelers were lining up opposite Joey Porter Jr. last year. In my opinion, it's more difficult to find a cornerback who's tied-for-third in the NFL with 2 interceptions and can tackle, than it is to find a receiver who's averaging 11.4 yards per catch. If you want to trade player-for-player in the NFL, you have to give something to get something. NICHOLAS PELCHAR FROM PURCELLVILLE, VA: When a team like Dallas that has a good tight end, which the Cowboys always seem to have, and a top receiver, why don't we drop T.J. Watt back to cover the tight end on those third-and-long passing downs sometimes to keep the opponent guessing?
ANSWER: When it's a third-and-long situation, the quarterback is going to have to hold onto the ball and throw it down-the-field if he hopes to convert and keep the drive alive. And in a situation where a quarterback has to hold onto the ball, T.J. Watt – as one of the NFL's most prolific sackers of the quarterback – is most valuable to the Steelers working at his specialty. Having him drop into coverage can be utilized in some situations as a way to keep the opposing quarterback off balance – ask Kurt Warner about what he learned about that in Super Bowl XLIII – but third-and-long is not the time to have your best pass-rusher in coverage. WAYNE PHILLIPS FROM SPRING HILL, FL: Please help me understand the lack of usage of our tight ends in the passing game, particularly Pat Freiermuth. I thought in Arthur Smith's game plan he used them a lot.
ANSWER: I wouldn't be so quick to label what we're seeing now as "Arthur Smith's offense." There has been something of a revolving door along the offensive line, which has impacted the running game, as have injuries to Jaylen Warren and Cordarrelle Patterson. And then we cannot forget the quarterback situation. Justin Fields has performed better than any reasonable expectations, but it cannot be overlooked or dismissed that the plan was for Russell Wilson to be the starter in 2024. Wilson was signed for his abilities as a leader and a been-there, done-that NFL quarterback, but also because he has shown he sees the whole field and throws the football with anticipation, timing, and accuracy. The injuries, including the one to Wilson, are contributing to a lack of usage of the tight ends in the passing game, in my opinion. Here is a quote from Coach Mike Tomlin about Pat Freiermuth: "We just did long-term contract business with (Freiermuth). He's a tight end, but he is a receiver in that he is a central component of what we do in the passing game." WILLIAM YOUNG FROM BADEN, PA: Justin Fields has lost two games in a row. He may not have been the reason for the losses, but when healthy, would you start Russell Wilson at quarterback?
ANSWER: I don't believe for a minute that Justin Fields was singularly responsible for the losses to Indianapolis and Dallas, but I do believe that there are things Russell Wilson can provide that the Steelers need at this stage of the season. He is a veteran presence at a critical position, and he has the statistics, the Pro Bowls, and a Super Bowl ring on his resume to hold young players' attention. Wilson is experienced in ways that only a long and successful career can provide, and being voted a team captain showed what the locker room thought of the way he presented himself as a professional and a teammate. Russell Wilson was cleared medically to be a full participant in this week's first practice, and so if there is no setback there I believe it will come down to when he shows that he can do the things he used to do on the field in terms of movement, anticipation, accuracy, and poise. Once that box is checked, I see Wilson getting a chance to play in a game. MIKE PALOMBO FROM MCMURRAY, PA: When defenses are ranked based on points allowed, are total points allowed by the team used, or do they exclude points given up when the defense wasn't the field, like a pick-6, a scoop-and-score, kick returns, and safeties?
ANSWER: The NFL puts together a statistics package each week during the regular season, and when it calculates points-allowed-per-game, it's simply total points allowed divided by the number of games played. Then teams are listed in order of fewest to highest points-per-game allowed. And it works the same way in the category of points-per-game scored. Individual teams might do a deeper dive into these statistics, but the NFL does not. CHRIS HUGHES FROM VACAVILLE, CA: I'm going to the game in Las Vegas when the Steelers play the Raiders on Oct. 13. What color jerseys will the Steelers be wearing?
ANSWER: The Steelers will wear white jerseys for Sunday's game vs. the Raiders in Las Vegas. ROY PERRIN FROM RALEIGH, NC: Coach Mike Tomlin was asked on Oct. 8 about Isaiahh Loudermilk's skill-set being compatible with moving to be an edge rusher, and his answer was simply that his skill-set is not conducive to that kind of inclusion. It seemed a little out of character for him to comment on a player's limitations so conclusively. Was it frustration at the question being asked, or does he not consider that to even be a remote possibility and he was just being honest?
ANSWER: Here's a third possibility: You mis-heard his answer. Here is the answer to the question about Isaiahh Loudermilk from Coach Mike Tomlin's news conference: "He and (DeMarvin) Leal are defensive linemen who are participants on special teams. Both guys are on kickoff (coverage), and I think that speaks to their unique skill-sets and allows him the position flexibility to slide outside and give us some big-man presence when lines get short, certainly." ROD KEEFER FROM EDMOND, OK: Do you think we might reach a point where close plays, missed calls, and the like could be decided by polling the viewing audience? Surely we have the technology for fans to buzz in, tabulate votes, and reach a consensus in real time more quickly (and accurately) than seven humans on the field with limited views can.
ANSWER: I sincerely hope I am dead and buried long before the NFL would even consider such an absurd system that has the "viewing audience" determine the outcome of close plays during games. The "viewing audience" is not without a rooting interest, or a betting interest, and those watching with a beverage in their hand might have to take a breathalyzer. I am certainly on record as being a regular critic of NFL officials, but that doesn't mean I'm self-important enough to believe I should have a vote on the outcome of close plays.

==================================================

5 for Friday: Moore has been a settling factor Contributing Writer/Editor The Steelers have selected offensive tackles in the first round of the past two NFL Drafts in Broderick Jones and Troy Fautanu with the idea they would be the team's bookends on the offensive line of the future. Somebody forgot to tell Dan Moore Jr. that he was simply supposed to cede his starting spot at left tackle to one of the younger players. As he has done in each of the previous three years, Moore has locked down the Steelers' left tackle position this season. And he's playing better than ever. According to Pro Football Focus' grading system – which is not without its obvious flaws - Moore ranks 18th among all qualified offensive tackles this season in their grading system. Those grades are certainly subjective, but there is little doubt Moore is playing well. For some, a team selecting two players in the first round in back-to-back years might have sent them spiraling into a tailspin. Moore, however, accepted the challenge and has continued to work. Hard. "Dan is never moved by what's going on around him," Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin recently said of Moore. "There's a maturity to his approach to business. Oftentimes it is reflected in the consistency of his play." The Steelers have started four different offensive line combinations in their first five games. Four different players have made their first career NFL starts. Moore, who has missed one start in his career, has been the one constant in an ever-changing lineup along with rookie center Zach Frazier. But Frazier was one of those players making his first career start this season, leaving Moore as a cornerstone. For a player some couldn't wait to replace – perhaps even the Steelers – his durability and consistency has been appreciated. "Dan, since I've been here, he's been the ultimate pro," said left guard Isaac Seumalo, who returned to the lineup last week after missing the first four games of the season with a pectoral injury. "I think he's playing the best football of his life. He's always had the talent. Sometimes, it takes three or four years for a guy, but I think he's playing great. I'm excited he's still here and balling. He brings a positive attitude every day." Players are allowed to get better. In fact, it's expected if you want to continue to play in the NFL. As Tomlin often says, players need to constantly be improving or they won't be in the league long. A former fourth-round pick out of Texas A&M, the 26-year-old Moore has embodied that. • While on the subject of PFF grades, Frazier is in some elite company when it comes to where that website has him ranked. Per PFF, Frazier's grade of 81.8 places him fourth among all NFL centers and as its second-best rookie in the 2024 Draft Class. The only centers ranked ahead of him are Eric McCoy of the Saints, who is currently injured and out for the remainder of the season, Kansas City's Creed Humphrey and Baltimore's Tyler Linderbaum. The only rookie ahead of him is Las Vegas tight end Brock Bowers, whom the Steelers will be tasked this weekend with slowing down. Frazier has been, by far, the best of the five rookie centers who have started games this season. "He's been solid. I think his talent is pretty evident, even for as young as he is," Seumalo said of Frazier. "There are always going to be growing pains, but he's been great." Graham Barton of Tampa Bay, selected with the 26th pick in this year's draft, has started all five games for the Bucs at center, but is ranked 27th among NFL centers per PFF. Tanor Bortolini of the Colts is ranked 17th in limited playing time. Beaux Limmer of the Rams is 24th. Cooper Beebe with Dallas is 26th. Jackson Powers-Johnson, whom the Raiders selected 44th, making him the second center selected in this year's draft, has appeared in three games, starting two for Las Vegas, who the Steelers face this week. But his starts have come at guard, where he ranks 63rd among all players at that position per PFF. Mason McCormick, a fourth-round pick of the Steelers who has started their past two games, ranks 43rd, second among rookies behind Dominick Puni of the 49ers, who was a third-round selection. • Despite the NFL's move to the "Dynamic Kickoff" rules this season, the Steelers have only had five kickoff returns this season, four of which came last week against the Cowboys when their primary kick returners, Cordarrelle Patterson and Jaylen Warren, were sidelined. Having Patterson deep on kickoffs is a deterrent to opponents to kick the ball where it can be returned. After all, he's got nine kick returns for touchdowns in his career, the most in NFL history.

(Alysa Rubin / Pittsburgh Steelers) Through the first five weeks of the season, however, we've still just seen a slight uptick from 2023 in the number of kicks that have been returned. Last season, just 22.1 percent of kickoffs were returned. This season, that number sits at 30.8. But with Patterson out again this week against the Raiders, don't be surprised if the Steelers get at least a couple of more opportunities to return kickoffs. The Raiders have given 11 opponents the opportunity to return a kick in their first five games. With Patterson and Warren both sidelined last week, running back Aaron Shampklin had four returns and averaged 25.3 yards with a long of 32 yards. • One matchup to watch in Sunday's game at Las Vegas is that between Steelers right tackle Broderick Jones and Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby. The Raiders move Crosby, their best pass rusher by far, around on the line. But he does align at left defensive end 79.6 percent of the time, which would put him in Jones' crosshairs. Thus far this season per NFL's NextGen Stats, Jones has allowed just half a sack and 12 pressures on 139 pass blocks, a pressure rate of just 8.6 percent. Jones' average time to pressure is 3.41 seconds, which is ninth-best among right tackles. And Jones and Detroit's Penei Sewell, who is considered by some to be the best right tackle in the NFL, are the only two players at the position who have not allowed a single "quick" pressure this season. • Dale Lolley is co-host of "SNR Drive" on Steelers Nation Radio. Subscribe to the podcast here: Apple Podcast | iHeart Podcast A quick pressure is in 2.5 seconds or less. Steelers quarterback Justin Fields is holding the ball 2.99 seconds, which is the fifth-highest time to throw in the NFL this season. • If it seems like there have been a lot of close games this season, it is because that has been the case. Four of the first five games involving the Steelers have been decided by eight points or less, which is nothing unusual for the team. The Steelers played 11 such games in 2023, going 9-2 in those games. They're 2-2 in those games this season, having lost their past two games by three points each. Overall, the NFL has seen 47 games decided by seven points or less – which would not include the Steelers' 18-10 win over Atlanta in Week 1 – and 41 decided by six points or less. That is the most such games five weeks into the season in NFL history. Last week, that included six out of 13 games being decided by a game-winning score in the final two minutes, including the Steelers' 20-17 loss to the Cowboys. They're gut-wrenching losses or exhilarating wins depending upon which side of the ledger your favorite team winds up.

==================================================

Fields looking to unlock explosive plays Contributing Writer/Editor Justin Fields has accounted for eight touchdowns – five passing and three rushing – in the Steelers' first five games. But with opponents now loading the box to stop the running game, he'd like to create more splash plays to make things easier on the team's offense as a whole. The Steelers ran into a stacked box – eight or more defenders – well over 40 percent of the time in last week's 20-17 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. The result was running back Najee Harris finishing the game with 14 carries for 42 yards, as Dallas just sold out to stop the run anytime Harris was on the field. Fields and the passing game tried to take advantage of the Cowboys' taking those chances, particularly taking some shots early in the game, but he finished with no completions in six attempts of passes or 20 or more yards downfield, missing some of those throws by inches. "(We) definitely need to create explosives," Fields said Thursday at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex. "But I think we had a chance, and the first one to Connor (Heyward) was, six inches, maybe a foot out too far in front of (him) to where he had to dive. "Art (offensive coordinator Arthur Smith) is going to make sure we get our shot plays in and, you know, try to create some of those explosives, but it's really just connecting downfield. And of course that starts up front with protection and stuff like that, but usually, once we do that, you know, it just becomes pitch and catch." It's no secret the Steelers want to be a run-first team. Five games into the season, they're running the ball 52.2 percent of the time. Only three teams – the Commanders, Chargers and Ravens – have run it more frequently. But opposing defenses also have figured that out and are stacking the box accordinging. There are few things that back a defense off the line of scrimmage quite like hitting some big plays in the passing game. "I think so," said Fields, who is averaging 5.9 yards per pass attempt. "The defense might start getting into shell and stuff like that, really just depending on who you play. But, every game you want a good number of explosive plays. You know, that's just going to get the offense in a rhythm, and just kind of get the whole team rolling." Getting top wideout George Pickens involved in that aspect of the game also could help. Pickens is drawing a lot of attention from opposing defenses, but Fields knows he also has to take his shots to the Steelers' top receiving threat. He just doesn't want to force those opportunities. "I think you have to let it come to you," Fields said. "You really don't want to force it because it kind of messes up your flow as a quarterback. At the same time, as a quarterback, you want to give one of your best playmakers the ball and have the ball in his hands because he's great with it. He can make plays down the field. So really just finding a balance and not necessarily forcing the ball, but when he is open and when there's a chance to get into the ball, definitely feed him for sure." Pickens displayed some frustration in Sunday's loss when he was limited to three receptions for 26 yards on a team-high seven targets. Fields, who was teammates with Pickens on a 7-on-7 team when both were in high school, is accustomed to dealing with Pickens when he's frustrated. He leans on that experience to deal with his teammate. "It's tough," Fields admitted. "You've definitely got to feel for him. He's just passionate about the game, and he knows how great of a player he is and it's tough. So I think just talking to him, I try to talk to him on the sideline, keep him up. I think that's the biggest thing, keeping him going and just trying to talk to him throughout the whole game and just stay in his ear and say, 'We're going to need you to make a big play soon and when that happens, we're going to need you.' "So the biggest thing is just being patient and him waiting for the ball to come his way because at the end of the day, defenses know that we're trying to give him the ball so they're going to game plan and do what they can to try to stop that." • Dale Lolley is co-host of "SNR Drive" on Steelers Nation Radio. Subscribe to the podcast here: Apple Podcast | iHeart Podcast Wilson trending up: Veteran Russell Wilson made it through his second consecutive day of full practice on Thursday as he works to come back from a calf issue that has plagued him since early in training camp. Wilson, who missed two weeks of training camp before aggravating the injury just a few days before the Steelers' regular season opener in which he was slated to start, said the calf has responded well to the additional workload this week. "I was able to do a lot more this week," the 13-year veteran said Thursday. "It was exciting to get back out there this week so far and be a full participant and do everything, all the reps and everything else, so that was great and we just got better from the first day to today it felt even better, so that was a good thing." Fields has been taking starter reps this week with Wilson still working his way back into the lineup. But Wilson has taken second-team snaps and said he has moved about in the pocket and done the things he feels he needs to do to cross the next step for him, which is to be active on game day. He's served as the No. 3 emergency quarterback thus far this season. The final decision regarding his status for Sunday's game against the Raiders will fall to head coach Mike Tomlin and the team's training staff along with Wilson. "I feel confident that I'd be ready to play and play at a high level, and I think we're being really smart too and trying to understand exactly how I feel," Wilson said. "It's my first week really back out there with the guys and playing and all that stuff, so I feel really confident about that and the ball's spinning, and that's a good thing."

==================================================

Austin looking for next man up at outside linebacker Contributing Writer/Editor After allowing just 26 points in their first three games, the Steelers have given up 47 in their past two, both losses. A big part of that has been the defense's inability to get off the field in critical situations. After limiting their first three opponents to just seven third-down conversions on 32 attempts, a 21.9 percent success rate, the Steelers have allowed 17 conversions on 30 attempts (56.7 percent) in their past two games. Blown coverages and a lack of overall pressure has been a part of that, as the Steelers have been forced to shuffle players in and out of the lineup at outside linebacker with injuries to Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig, along with having some issues with newer players in the secondary. Fixing some of those issues will be job No. 1 for defensive coordinator Teryl Austin as the Steelers (3-2) head to Las Vegas to face the Raiders (2-3) Sunday. With Highsmith, Herbig and fellow backup DeMarvin Leal all declared out for Sunday's game because of injuries, the Steelers will be forced to lean on Jeremiah Moon, activated last week from the reserve/injured list, and practice squad players Adetokunbo Ogundeji and Eku Leota at outside linebacker this week opposite T.J. Watt. The Steelers have always used a next-man-up-mentality when it comes to injuries. But this is a next-men-up situation. "We're going to be short-handed, but in the sense of guys that haven't played for us here, but we've got a couple of the young guys that are possibly available to us," said defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. Highsmith was already out against the Cowboys because of a groin injury, putting Herbig in the starting lineup. He then suffered a hamstring injury in the first half against Dallas. Leal suffered a neck injury in the second half of that game, forcing Moon to play 28 defensive snaps despite having taken part in just three practices last week before being activated on Saturday. The Steelers were so thin at outside linebacker, defensive lineman Isaiahh Loudermilk was pushed outside on some pass rush downs, as well. "We used (Loudermilk) in a pinch last week. He's athletic. He's big. I know he's not going to rush from the outside like the other guys, but in terms of the run game, he'll be fine," Austin said. "We'll count on probably a couple of these young guys to kind of step up. Moon stepped up, played a little bit more than we thought he was going to play last week just coming out of the bullpen. Then we have a couple of practice squad guys, and we'll see how they shake out at the end of the week in terms of who may be a guy to help us." The one thing the Steelers can count upon is the presence of Watt, who last week became the second-fastest player in NFL history to reach 100 career sacks. Not only does Watt garner a lot of attention from opposing offenses, he also can be a help to the younger or new players at his position. "Yeah," Austin said regarding the newer players learning from Watt. "I think that they've been here now. You know, Adei's been here a little bit longer than Eku, so I think being in the room and being being around really helps them and in terms of acclimating and being able to step in, and that's why we got those guys. Those guys have played NFL football before, and they're here for this or that reason, so that if we do get banged up, I mean, we can bring them up and we can play, and they'll give us a good day's work." Communication could be the critical part of that equation. Some of the issues the Steelers have had in recent weeks stopping the run and giving up some explosive passing plays have stemmed from that. Getting everyone on the same page and knowing their assignments with some moving parts can always be an issue. • Dale Lolley is co-host of "SNR Drive" on Steelers Nation Radio. Subscribe to the podcast here: Apple Podcast | iHeart Podcast "It's always a work in progress, just like your scheme and the things that you do. So we've just got to continue to work at it," Austin said. "When I say it's a work in progress, like a lot of things you do, you don't always do everything the same every week. So we just came up short in that area the last few weeks. We've got to continue to work at it to try to make it better. "We do things in terms of practice and how we practice and the crowd noise and signals and communication, just to - it just has to continue to be like any other part of your game an emphasis for you. So we have to continue to emphasize it so we can get the best out of it." And Austin still expects to be able to pressure the quarterback, regardless of who is in the game, whether that's via the blitz or with a four-man rush. The Steelers are blitzing at about a 20 percent rate this season. "We still hold to our principles here," Austin said. "We'll pressure, but we also like the four-man rush when we get in some situations and let our guys win. So I don't think that's going to change a whole lot. "We'll count on the guys we bring up to give us some pressure. We know we have a premier pass rusher on one side and we have a premier pass rusher inside (Cam Heyward), so we've got to generate some good work from the outside guys that are filling in, and we'll go from there."

Under Smith's guidance, the Falcons led the NFL in fewest penalties (2022), ranked third in successful play rate on rushing attempts, based on EPA, (2022), ﬁnished third in rushing yards/game (2022), ninth in rushing yards/game (2023), 10th in third-down conversion rate (2022), 13th in third-down conversion rate (2023) and 13th in passing yards/attempt (2023).

Season Ticket Holders | Pittsburgh Steelers - Steelers.com Contact Us: PHONE (412) 785-7773 E-MAIL sth@steelers.com My Steelers Account Wait List Benefits Frequently Asked Questions You may purchase up to four (4) seats. All ten guaranteed home games are included in the season ticket package, from preseason through the final regular season home game. Seat license fee prices start at $1,250 per seat and will vary depending on location. Seat license fees are a required purchase for all licensed seat locations within Acrisure Stadium. 500-level licensed seating: $1,250 (rows EE-LL) Sections 504-517 and 528-541 $1,500 (rows R-DD) Sections 504-517 and 528-541 $2,500 (rows F-Q) Sections 504-517 and 528-541 $3,000 (rows A-E) Sections 504-508, 513-517, 528-532, and 537-541 $4,500 (rows A-E) Sections 509-512 and 533-536 Lower bowl seating: $4,000 (sections 120-125, sections 145-152, and sections 220-225) $5,000 (sections 101 row FF-MM, section 144 row KK-PP, sections 102-107, sections 114-119, sections 126-131, sections 138-143, and sections 217, 218, 227, and 228) $12,000 (sections 108-113 and sections 132-137) Club seating: $5,000 (North Club sections) Sections NC001-NC013 $5,000 (sections 205-207, sections 214-216, sections 229-231, sections 238-240, and all PNC Champions Club sections C148-C150 and FC1-FC5) $10,000 (sections 208-213 and sections 232-237) A seat license allows the account holder to resell or transfer seat license ownership of seats once he or she no longer wishes to purchase season tickets. For unlicensed seats, season tickets can remain in the account holder's name only. Once the account holder of unlicensed seats no longer wishes to or is no longer able to renew the seats, those seats are returned to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Unlicensed seat locations include sections 519-526, section 219, section 226, and sections 101 rows A-EE and 144 rows A-JJ. If we have licensed seats available through our office, the seat license fees will be applied to those seat locations. The seat license is a required, one-time, nonrefundable fee, so once it is paid, you are only responsible for purchasing the season ticket package each year. No, your unlicensed seats will remain in your name for each season as long as you choose to purchase them. Unlicensed seats do not have an associated seat license, so they also do not have a licensed seat owner. Therefore, your unlicensed seats are renewable to you each year. No, all unlicensed seat locations are and will remain permanently unlicensed. The Pittsburgh Steelers have a relocation request process for Season Ticket Holders who wish to relocate within Acrisure Stadium. Each Season Ticket Holder becomes eligible to request a relocation after completing one full season with the team. Requests should be submitted to the Steelers by email and can be made for unlicensed or licensed seat locations. Yes, you are still able to post tickets for sale and transfer individual game tickets through your Account Manager, even if your seats are unlicensed. Yes, as a season ticket holder, you would have first right of refusal to your seat location for potential postseason games. Each new Season Ticket Holder will receive postseason registration information in mid-August. Postseason games are not a required purchase, but we would love to have you join us at Acrisure Stadium for playoffs! You will be able to receive two offers while on the Wait List.

Since its beginning, the scholarship has awarded grants to more than 80 local students.

The event features a 3.1-mile level course on the North Side highlighted by a spectacular finish inside of the stadium. Crucial Catch The NFL, its clubs, players, and the American Cancer Society are committed to the NFL's Crucial Catch mission to fight cancer through early detection and prevention. The Steelers are continuing to support breast cancer awareness and participate in numerous initiatives.

The team recognizes local breast cancer survivors in a pregame ceremony and pink Terrible Towels are distributed to all fans at the game by UPMC volunteers.

All 32 teams nominated a local youth to represent their team, and Gonzalez was the Steelers nominee, and then the finalist who represented the AFC North.

Interest-Based Advertising About Interest-Based Advertising We partner with third party advertisers, as well as analytics and measurement partners, to serve and display advertising on the Services and elsewhere online across different sites and services. These partners may use cookies and similar technologies on the Services and elsewhere online to collect and share information about your activities across different websites, mobile applications, and services to provide you with relevant advertising ("Interest-Based Advertising" or "IBA"). For example, we may conduct analysis on your behavior in order to provide you with Interest-Based Advertising both on and off the Services. "We may also disclose non cookie-based information for advertising purposes, including for Interest-Based Advertising. For example, we may disclose information to social networking platforms, so that they may send tailored communications on our behalf via their platforms. To serve and display advertising relevant to your location, where permitted by law and depending on the Services you use, the Services may also track your device's precise geolocation by responding to beacons or inaudible signals sent to your device's microphone. This is typically done based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. Opting Out of IBA You can opt out of receiving some type of ads and third-party collection of data for IBA from your device across unaffiliated services by managing your preferences at https://youradchoices.com/control. You can also manage third-party cookies that collect data from NFL-affiliated websites and mobile applications for Interest-Based Advertising by setting your preferences on the website, mobile application, or other service via "Privacy Settings" or "Cookie Settings."

Social Networking The NFL works with certain third-party social media providers to offer you their social networking services through our Services. For example, you can use third-party social networking services to share information about your experience on our Services with your friends and followers on those social networking services. These social networking services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on our Services. These third-party social networking services also may notify your friends, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those social networking services. Your interactions with those social networking services are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant service. You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat) to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign into certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Notice. 7. Links to Other Websites The Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under our control or maintained by us. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith. This Privacy Notice does not apply to this third-party content. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services. 8. Data Security and Data Integrity The security and confidentiality of your personal information is very important to the NFL. We have implemented technical and organizational safeguards designed to appropriately protect your personal information against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful access, use, loss, destruction, or damage. Still, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to the Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information. 9. Data Transfers When we transfer your personal information to third parties as described in this Privacy Notice, some of these parties may be located in countries other than your own, such as the United States, whose privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to those in your country of residence. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we apply appropriate safeguards, to protect your information in accordance with applicable laws. For example, some NFL entities implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred personal information remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by emailing enquiries@nfl.com. If you would like to know more about the processing of your personal information and whether your personal information is transferred to a third country, please contact us using any of the methods described in Contact Us. 10. Data Retention We will retain your information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above, considering criteria such as applicable rules on statute of limitations, any legal requirements to retain your personal information in light of compliance obligations, any relevant litigation or regulatory investigations and to enable the NFL to defend or bring potential legal claims, the sensitivity of the relevant information, and the duration of your use of the Services. 11. Children's Privacy We do not knowingly collect personal information from children as defined by local law. If we learn that a child has provided us with personal information, we will delete it or otherwise comply with applicable law. 12. Communications Preferences and Other Choices You may choose to receive promotional emails, text messages, newsletters, push notifications, and similar communications from us. You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from the applicable Member Club or other members of the NFL Family by clicking on the opt-out or "unsubscribe" link included in the commercial emails you receive. You may opt out of receiving marketing text messages from the applicable Member Club or other member of the NFL Family by replying "STOP." You may also opt out of receiving push notifications by turning off push notifications through your device settings. If you have multiple accounts or relationships with different Member Clubs or other NFL entities, you may need to opt out separately for each account and relationship in relation to these choices. In addition, if you would like to opt out of receiving push notifications on all of your devices, you must turn off the feature on each device. Please note that opt-out requests may take some time to be effective where permitted by applicable law. Your opt-out requests will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature. For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages. Certain of our Services may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow users to contribute to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings. Nielsen believes that you should have a choice about whether to contribute to our research and insights. To learn more about Nielsen measurement and your choices, including how to opt out, please visit http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy. You may also have choices available to you to opt out of the collection of your geolocation information, whether collected through location services, Bluetooth, or microphone access technology. Where collected, this information may be used in accordance with local laws to serve and display advertising relevant to your location. To understand your choices and opt out if desired, please visit your device settings. 13. Data Subject Rights Certain states in the United States and other international jurisdictions grant certain rights with respect to personal information. Depending on where you reside and in accordance with applicable law, you may be afforded the following rights: To exercise your access, deletion, and correction rights, please submit your request by visiting our Data Subject Request Portal. If you would like to object to, or request the restriction of, processing of your personal information, withdraw your consent, or if you are otherwise not able to submit a request via the portal above, you can contact the NFL by filling out an inquiry here. You may also be afforded, depending on where you reside and in accordance with applicable law, certain rights relating to the collection, use, and disclosure of your sensitive personal information. Please note that we may still maintain, use, and disclose your sensitive personal information for certain purposes, such as to provide you with services that you have requested, protect the safety and security of services, and comply with our legal obligations. Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, you may also be afforded the right to opt out of the sale, sharing, or processing of your personal information for purposes of serving you advertisements based on your activity across other sites and services ("cross-context behavioral advertising" or "targeted advertising"). You may exercise these opt-out choices with respect to your cookie-based personal information by visiting "Privacy Settings" in applicable apps or the "Cookie Settings" link in the footer of applicable websites and toggling off Selling, Sharing, Targeted Advertising cookies. You may also exercise these opt-out choices with respect to your non-cookie-based personal information by clicking the "Your Privacy Choices" link in the footer of applicable sites. Global Privacy Control and "Do Not Track" Signals: Our websites also support the Global Privacy Control ("GPC"), which is a browser-based opt-out preference signal that can communicate your state law opt-out requests to the websites you visit. For more information on how the GPC works, visit their website here. Because the GPC is browser-based, note that your choices will be tied to online data that is associated with your browser, and you should enable the signal separately for each browser and/or device from which you would like to be opted out. Our websites do not support "do-not-track" signals, as there is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. Note that we do not knowingly sell or share for cross-context behavioral advertising the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices, although some of the functionality and features available to you may change or no longer be available to you. We may verify certain types of requests by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. Authorized agents may exercise rights on your behalf using the same mechanisms described herein, but we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. We reserve the right to deny requests as allowed by applicable law, such as where we have a reasonable belief that the request is fraudulent, where your identity cannot be confirmed, or where the NFL must retain your information consistent with applicable law. You can, however, appeal those requests that we deny by submitting a request here. 14. NFL Events Information When You Attend An NFL Event: When you attend an NFL-event or NFL co-hosted event, including NFL games at an NFL stadium or at a third party stadium or other NFL fan events (including events at which a fan mobile pass is utilized) ("NFL Event"), we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location at an NFL Event. You should therefore expect to be filmed or photographed by CCTV and/or by cameras when you are in a public location at an NFL Event (e.g., as an audience-member in the stadium if you are attending a game). In addition to describing how we capture and use your image, voice and/or likeness in this Privacy Notice, we may also display signs at any NFL Event indicating that you may be filmed or photographed. We may use your personal information collected at an NFL Event: Sharing your personal information from an NFL Event: We may disclose your personal information captured at an NFL Event with any of the entities set out in this Privacy Notice, as described in Disclosure of Information. Additionally, when you appear in a photograph or film footage at an NFL Event, we may disclose that photograph or film footage containing your image, voice, and/or likeness with our third-party partners. These partners include our sponsors, licensees, advertisers, and/or broadcasters. We will disclose the photographs or film footage containing your image, voice and/or likeness when it is in our legitimate business interests to do so. However, each of the third-party partners may use your personal information for their independent commercial purposes without reference to the NFL. Please also note that broadcasters and other third parties that are unconnected to the NFL may be independently filming or photographing you when you attend an NFL Event. Although we only give permission to a small group of entities (such as certain broadcasters) to film or photograph NFL Events, these entities are separate data controllers in respect of your personal information, and the NFL is not responsible for how those parties use your personal information and for what purposes. 15. Changes To This Privacy Notice We may update this Privacy Notice, including any supplemental privacy disclosures, to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective.

DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT
Steelers will respond to alleged copyright violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").

If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Third Party Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a written notification pursuant to DMCA by providing Steelers with the following: 1) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; 2) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; 3) Identification of the Third Party Content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit Steelers to locate the material; 4) Information reasonably sufficient to permit Steelers to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address; 5) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the Third Party Content in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and 6) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. B. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Third Party Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Third Party Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to Steelers at the address set forth below: 1) Your physical or electronic signature; 2) Identification of the Third Party Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Third Party Content appeared before it was removed or disabled; 3) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Third Party Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Third Party Content; and 4) Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal court in Seattle, Washington, USA, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. 5) If a counter-notice is received by Steelers, Steelers may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Steelers may replace the removed Third Party Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Third Party Content provider, member or user, the removed Third Party Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Steelers' sole discretion. 6) You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 13, your DMCA notice may not be valid. 7) Steelers will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail or facsimile at the following address: Pittsburgh Steelers LLC, 100 Art Rooney Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15212 Attention: Amy Regan It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed. Steelers may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and Steelers may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA. Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability. We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work. That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification. Without limiting Steelers' other rights, Steelers may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer's access to the Site and any other website owned or operated by Steelers. You should also be aware that we may forward the DMCA Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice. Site Copyright

Interest-Based Advertising About Interest-Based Advertising We partner with third party advertisers, as well as analytics and measurement partners, to serve and display advertising on the Services and elsewhere online across different sites and services. These partners may use cookies and similar technologies on the Services and elsewhere online to collect and share information about your activities across different websites, mobile applications, and services to provide you with relevant advertising ("Interest-Based Advertising" or "IBA"). For example, we may conduct analysis on your behavior in order to provide you with Interest-Based Advertising both on and off the Services. "We may also disclose non cookie-based information for advertising purposes, including for Interest-Based Advertising. For example, we may disclose information to social networking platforms, so that they may send tailored communications on our behalf via their platforms. To serve and display advertising relevant to your location, where permitted by law and depending on the Services you use, the Services may also track your device's precise geolocation by responding to beacons or inaudible signals sent to your device's microphone. This is typically done based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.

Social Networking The NFL works with certain third-party social media providers to offer you their social networking services through our Services. For example, you can use third-party social networking services to share information about your experience on our Services with your friends and followers on those social networking services. These social networking services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on our Services. These third-party social networking services also may notify your friends, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those social networking services. Your interactions with those social networking services are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant service. You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat) to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign into certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Notice. 7. Links to Other Websites The Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under our control or maintained by us. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith. This Privacy Notice does not apply to this third-party content. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services. 8. Data Security and Data Integrity The security and confidentiality of your personal information is very important to the NFL. We have implemented technical and organizational safeguards designed to appropriately protect your personal information against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful access, use, loss, destruction, or damage. Still, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to the Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information. 9. Data Transfers When we transfer your personal information to third parties as described in this Privacy Notice, some of these parties may be located in countries other than your own, such as the United States, whose privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to those in your country of residence. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we apply appropriate safeguards, to protect your information in accordance with applicable laws. For example, some NFL entities implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred personal information remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by emailing enquiries@nfl.com. If you would like to know more about the processing of your personal information and whether your personal information is transferred to a third country, please contact us using any of the methods described in Contact Us. 10. Data Retention We will retain your information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above, considering criteria such as applicable rules on statute of limitations, any legal requirements to retain your personal information in light of compliance obligations, any relevant litigation or regulatory investigations and to enable the NFL to defend or bring potential legal claims, the sensitivity of the relevant information, and the duration of your use of the Services. 11. Children's Privacy We do not knowingly collect personal information from children as defined by local law. If we learn that a child has provided us with personal information, we will delete it or otherwise comply with applicable law. 12. Communications Preferences and Other Choices You may choose to receive promotional emails, text messages, newsletters, push notifications, and similar communications from us. You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from the applicable Member Club or other members of the NFL Family by clicking on the opt-out or "unsubscribe" link included in the commercial emails you receive. You may opt out of receiving marketing text messages from the applicable Member Club or other member of the NFL Family by replying "STOP." You may also opt out of receiving push notifications by turning off push notifications through your device settings. If you have multiple accounts or relationships with different Member Clubs or other NFL entities, you may need to opt out separately for each account and relationship in relation to these choices. In addition, if you would like to opt out of receiving push notifications on all of your devices, you must turn off the feature on each device. Please note that opt-out requests may take some time to be effective where permitted by applicable law. Your opt-out requests will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature. For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages. Certain of our Services may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow users to contribute to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings. Nielsen believes that you should have a choice about whether to contribute to our research and insights. To learn more about Nielsen measurement and your choices, including how to opt out, please visit http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy. You may also have choices available to you to opt out of the collection of your geolocation information, whether collected through location services, Bluetooth, or microphone access technology. Where collected, this information may be used in accordance with local laws to serve and display advertising relevant to your location. To understand your choices and opt out if desired, please visit your device settings. 13. Data Subject Rights Certain states in the United States and other international jurisdictions grant certain rights with respect to personal information. Depending on where you reside and in accordance with applicable law, you may be afforded the following rights: To exercise your access, deletion, and correction rights, please submit your request by visiting our Data Subject Request Portal. If you would like to object to, or request the restriction of, processing of your personal information, withdraw your consent, or if you are otherwise not able to submit a request via the portal above, you can contact the NFL by filling out an inquiry here. You may also be afforded, depending on where you reside and in accordance with applicable law, certain rights relating to the collection, use, and disclosure of your sensitive personal information. Please note that we may still maintain, use, and disclose your sensitive personal information for certain purposes, such as to provide you with services that you have requested, protect the safety and security of services, and comply with our legal obligations. Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, you may also be afforded the right to opt out of the sale, sharing, or processing of your personal information for purposes of serving you advertisements based on your activity across other sites and services ("cross-context behavioral advertising" or "targeted advertising"). You may exercise these opt-out choices with respect to your cookie-based personal information by visiting "Privacy Settings" in applicable apps or the "Cookie Settings" link in the footer of applicable websites and toggling off Selling, Sharing, Targeted Advertising cookies. You may also exercise these opt-out choices with respect to your non-cookie-based personal information by clicking the "Your Privacy Choices" link in the footer of applicable sites. Global Privacy Control and "Do Not Track" Signals: Our websites also support the Global Privacy Control ("GPC"), which is a browser-based opt-out preference signal that can communicate your state law opt-out requests to the websites you visit. For more information on how the GPC works, visit their website here. Because the GPC is browser-based, note that your choices will be tied to online data that is associated with your browser, and you should enable the signal separately for each browser and/or device from which you would like to be opted out. Our websites do not support "do-not-track" signals, as there is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. Note that we do not knowingly sell or share for cross-context behavioral advertising the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices, although some of the functionality and features available to you may change or no longer be available to you. We may verify certain types of requests by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. Authorized agents may exercise rights on your behalf using the same mechanisms described herein, but we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. We reserve the right to deny requests as allowed by applicable law, such as where we have a reasonable belief that the request is fraudulent, where your identity cannot be confirmed, or where the NFL must retain your information consistent with applicable law. You can, however, appeal those requests that we deny by submitting a request here. 14. NFL Events Information When You Attend An NFL Event: When you attend an NFL-event or NFL co-hosted event, including NFL games at an NFL stadium or at a third party stadium or other NFL fan events (including events at which a fan mobile pass is utilized) ("NFL Event"), we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location at an NFL Event. You should therefore expect to be filmed or photographed by CCTV and/or by cameras when you are in a public location at an NFL Event (e.g., as an audience-member in the stadium if you are attending a game). In addition to describing how we capture and use your image, voice and/or likeness in this Privacy Notice, we may also display signs at any NFL Event indicating that you may be filmed or photographed. We may use your personal information collected at an NFL Event: Sharing your personal information from an NFL Event: We may disclose your personal information captured at an NFL Event with any of the entities set out in this Privacy Notice, as described in Disclosure of Information. Additionally, when you appear in a photograph or film footage at an NFL Event, we may disclose that photograph or film footage containing your image, voice, and/or likeness with our third-party partners. These partners include our sponsors, licensees, advertisers, and/or broadcasters. We will disclose the photographs or film footage containing your image, voice and/or likeness when it is in our legitimate business interests to do so. However, each of the third-party partners may use your personal information for their independent commercial purposes without reference to the NFL. Please also note that broadcasters and other third parties that are unconnected to the NFL may be independently filming or photographing you when you attend an NFL Event. Although we only give permission to a small group of entities (such as certain broadcasters) to film or photograph NFL Events, these entities are separate data controllers in respect of your personal information, and the NFL is not responsible for how those parties use your personal information and for what purposes. 15. Changes To This Privacy Notice We may update this Privacy Notice, including any supplemental privacy disclosures, to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective.
